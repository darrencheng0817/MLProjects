I/PRP did/VB not/RB have/VB too/RB much/JJ interest/NN in/IN watching/VB The/VB Flock.Andrew/NN Lau/NN co-directed/IN the/DT masterpiece/NN trilogy/VB of/RP Infernal/NN Affairs/NN but/CC he/PRP had/VB been/VB fired/VB from/IN The/DT Flock/NN and/CC he/PRP had/VB been/VB replaced/VB by/IN an/DT emergency/NN director/NN called/VB Niels/NN Mueller.I/NN had/VB the/DT feeling/NN that/WH Lau/NN had/VB made/VB a/DT good/JJ film/NN but/CC it/PRP had/VB not/RB satisfied/VB the/DT study,so/NN they/PRP fired/VB him/PRP and/CC hired/VB another/DT director.This/NN usually/RB does/VB not/RB work/VB well/RB (let's/VB remember/VB The/DT Invasion).But/NN The/DT Flock/NN resulted/VB to/TO be/VB better/RB than/IN what/WH I/PRP expected.It's/VB not/RB a/DT great/JJ film/NN but/CC it's/VB an/DT interesting/JJ and/CC entertaining/JJ thriller.The/NN character/NN development/NN is/VB very/RB well/RB done/VB and/CC I/PRP could/MD know/VB the/DT characters/NN very/RB well.Also,the/JJ relationship/NN between/IN the/DT two/CD main/JJ characters/NN is/VB natural/JJ and/CC credible.Richard/RP Gere/NN and/CC Claire/NN Danes/NN bring/VB competent/JJ performances.Now,let's/NN go/VB to/TO the/DT negative/JJ points.One/NN element/NN which/WH really/RB bothered/VB me/PRP (there/MD was/VB a/DT moment/NN in/IN which/WH it/PRP irritated/VB me)/TO was/VB the/DT excess/JJ of/IN edition/NN tricks/NN to/TO give/VB the/DT movie/NN more/JJ "attitude"/NN and/CC style.That/NN tricks/NN feel/VB out/RP of/IN place/NN and/CC their/PRP$ presence/NN is/VB arbitrary.Plus,I/TO think/VB the/DT film/NN should/MD have/VB been/VB more/JJ ambitious.In/NN spite/NN of/IN that,I/NN recommend/VB The/DT Flock/NN as/IN a/DT good/JJ thriller.It's/NN not/RB memorable/JJ at/IN all,but/DT it's/NN entertaining./NN
