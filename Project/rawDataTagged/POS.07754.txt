of/IN the/DT five/CD Japanese/JJ entries/NN in/IN the/DT Ju-On/NN series/NN to/TO date/VB (the/VB fifth/RB is/VB currently/RB in/IN production),/NN and/CC writer/NN Stephen/NN Susco/NN have/VB

even/RB if/IN you're/NN not/RB used/VB to/TO it,/VB it's/DT worth/NN trying/VB to/TO suspend/VB your/PRP$ normal/JJ preconceptions/NN about/IN films/NN and/CC give/VB The/DT Grudge/NN a/DT shot./NN This/DT is/VB a/DT well/RB written,/VB well/RB directed,/VB well/RB acted/VB film,/TO filled/VB with/IN unusual/JJ properties,/NN such/JJ as/IN the/DT story/NN interweaving/IN a/DT large/JJ number/NN
