Ah/UH WINTER/NN KILLS/NN ,/. based/VB on/IN the/DT novel/NN by/IN Richard/NN Condon/NN which/WH deals/NN with/IN a/DT conspiracy/NN that/WH killed/VB the/DT president/NN of/IN the/DT United/NN States/NN 20/CD years/NN ago/RB ./. I/PRP knew/VB Condon/NN also/RB wrote/VB THE/DT MANCHURIAN/NN CANDIDATE/NN which/WH dealt/VB with/IN a/DT similar/JJ theme/NN and/CC was/VB looking/VB forward/RB to/TO seeing/VB an/DT intelligent/JJ thriller<br/NN /><br/VB />WINTER/RP KILLS/NN left/VB me/PRP cold/JJ ./. It's/NN not/RB a/DT thriller/NN -/. It's/NN a/DT piece/NN of/IN worthless/JJ crap/NN ,/. possibly/RB the/DT worst/JJ movie/NN I've/NN seen/VB this/DT month/NN and/CC boy/NN have/VB I/PRP seen/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN bad/JJ movies/NN in/IN June/NN ./. The/DT problem/NN lies/VB in/IN both/PDT the/DT direction/NN and/CC the/DT script/NN and/CC seeing/VB as/IN William/NN Richert/NN was/VB responsible/JJ for/IN both/DT then/RB he/PRP should/MD be/VB blamed/VB entirely/RB for/IN this/DT unfunny/NN farce/NN <br/NN /><br/IN />There's/$ two/CD things/NN wrong/JJ with/IN this/DT movie/NN ./. First/RB off/RB is/VB the/DT way/NN everything/NN is/VB presented/VB in/IN a/DT totally/RB over/IN the/DT top/JJ manner/NN ./. It's/NN not/RB as/RB OTT/NN as/IN say/VB something/NN like/IN that/DT James/NN Bond/NN movie/NN with/IN David/NN Niven/NN and/CC Peter/NN Sellers/NN but/CC everything/NN has/VB a/DT farcial/NN edge/NN to/TO it/PRP with/IN actors/NN completely/RB mugging/VB their/PRP$ performances/NN ./. This/DT might/MD have/VB been/VB justified/VB if/IN there/EX was/VB entertainment/NN value/NN to/TO the/DT movie/NN but/CC there's/NN none/NN ./. As/IN a/DT satire/NN it's/VB very/RB silly/JJ ,/. so/RB silly/JJ that/IN it/PRP becomes/VB almost/RB unwatchable/VB ./. Secondly/RB the/DT scenes/NN seem/VB to/TO have/VB been/VB cut/VB so/RB much/RB that/IN they're/NN rendered/VB senseless/NN ./. Take/VB for/IN example/NN a/DT scene/NN where/WH the/DT hero/NN is/VB confronting/VB a/DT loopy/NN militia/NN leader/NN called/VB Dawson/NN ./. Dawson/NN tells/VB the/DT hero/NN he/PRP has/VB 30/CD seconds/NN start/VB then/RB it/PRP cuts/VB to/TO the/DT hero/NN being/VB on/IN board/NN a/DT plane/NN ./. The/DT scenes/NN begin/VB and/CC end/NN with/IN no/DT rhyme/NN nor/CC reason<br/NN /><br/IN />A/DT dire/JJ movie/NN that's/IN an/DT ordeal/NN to/TO sit/VB through/IN
