You/PRP don't/MD need/VB to/TO read/VB this/DT review.<br/NN /><br/IN />An/DT earlier/JJ review,/NN by/IN pninson/VB of/RP Seattle,/NN has/VB already/RB identified/VB all/PDT the/DT main/JJ shortcomings/NN of/IN this/DT production./NN I/PRP can/MD only/RB amplify/VB its/PRP$ basic/JJ arguments.<br/NN /><br/IN />Bleak/DT House/NN was/VB a/DT relatively/RB late/JJ Dickens/NN novel/NN and/CC is/VB much/JJ darker/NN than/IN his/PRP$ earlier/JJ work./IN This/DT is/VB taken/VB too/RB literally/RB by/IN the/DT director,/NN Ross/NN Devenish,/NN who/WH piles/VB on/IN the/DT gloom/NN and/CC fog/VB too/RB much./. When/WH Ada,/NN Rick/NN and/CC Esther/NN appear,/IN half/PDT an/DT hour/NN into/IN the/DT opening/NN episode,/. it/PRP is/VB a/DT relief/NN just/RB to/TO be/VB in/IN daylight/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time./NN In/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT murkier/NN scenes/NN it/PRP was/VB hard/JJ to/TO see/VB what/WH was/VB actually/RB on/IN my/PRP$ TV/NN screen./. I/PRP watched/VB the/DT whole/JJ thing/NN in/IN one/CD day,/NN starting/VB in/IN mid-afternoon./NN As/IN daylight/NN faded/VB this/DT became/VB less/RB of/IN an/DT issue,/NN but/CC I/PRP have/VB a/DT pretty/RB good/JJ TV/NN and/CC I/PRP have/VB never/RB encountered/VB this/DT problem/NN before/IN at/IN any/DT time/NN of/IN day.<br/DT /><br/NN />The/NN pacing/NN is/VB very/RB deliberate/JJ (i.e./NN slow)./. I/PRP am/VB sure/RB this/DT was/VB intensional,/NN but/CC it/PRP is/VB overdone./IN There/EX are/VB numerous/JJ shots/NN of/IN people/NN trudging/VB though/IN the/DT muck/NN and/CC gloom/NN of/IN Victorian/JJ London/NN that/WH are/VB held/VB longer/RB than/IN is/VB necessary/JJ to/TO establish/VB the/DT mood/NN and/CC atmosphere./VB A/DT good/JJ editor/NN could/MD probably/RB take/VB several/JJ minutes/NN out/RP of/IN each/DT fifty-minute/NN episode,/NN without/IN losing/VB a/DT line/NN of/IN dialogue,/NN just/RB by/IN trimming/IN each/DT of/IN these/DT scenes/NN slightly.<br/IN /><br/DT />I/NN don't/NN want/VB to/TO overstate/VB these/DT two/CD problems./. You/PRP soon/RB adjust/VB to/TO the/DT look/NN and/CC pace/NN of/IN this/DT production./NN The/DT more/JJ important/JJ issue/NN is/VB that/IN it/PRP doesn't/VB always/RB tell/VB the/DT story/NN very/RB effectively./VB Earlier/RB Dickens/NN novels/NN are/VB as/RB long/RB as/RB Bleak/NN House,/NN but/CC are/VB not/RB nearly/RB so/RB intricately/JJ plotted./NN For/IN example,/VB I/PRP recently/RB re-read/JJ Nicholas/NN Nickleby/NN because/IN I/PRP was/VB intrigued/VB to/TO see/VB how/WH Douglas/NN McGrath/NN crammed/VB an/DT 800/CD page/NN book/NN into/IN his/PRP$ two-hour/JJ movie./IN The/DT answer/NN is/VB simple:/IN the/DT book/NN is/VB full/JJ of/IN padding./DT McGrath/NN cut/VB great/JJ swathes/NN of/IN the/DT novel/NN while/IN still/RB retaining/VB all/PDT the/DT essential/JJ story/NN elements./IN This/DT would/MD not/RB be/VB possible/JJ with/RP Bleak/NN House./NN <br/IN /><br/DT />This/NN production/NN needs/VB its/PRP$ seven/CD hours./TO Probably,/NN it/PRP needs/VB even/RB longer,/VB because/IN many/JJ elements/NN of/IN its/PRP$ convoluted/JJ plot/NN are/VB not/RB sufficiently/RB clear,/. or/CC as/RB well/RB handled,/VB as/IN they/PRP need/VB to/TO be./VB A/DT few/JJ random/JJ examples/NN will/MD illustrate/VB the/DT problems.<br/NN /><br/NN />The/VB maid,/RP Rosa,/NN appears/VB from/IN nowhere/RB with/IN no/DT background,/NN so/IN Lady/NN Dedlock's/NN attachment/VB to/TO her/PRP is/VB largely/RB unmotivated.<br/VB /><br/VB />Sergeant/RP George's/NN acquiescence/VB in/RP Tulkinhorn's/NN demand/NN for/IN a/DT sample/NN of/RP Horton's/NN handwriting/NN is/VB somewhat/RB fudged.<br/VB /><br/DT />It/NN is/VB not/RB made/VB clear/JJ enough/JJ that/IN Esther/NN is/VB actually/RB in/IN love/VB with/RP Woodcourt/NN when/WH she/PRP agrees/VB to/TO marry/VB John/NN Jarndyce./NN Neither/CC is/VB it/PRP clear/VB that/IN they/PRP have/VB agreed/VB not/RB to/TO announce/VB their/PRP$ engagement,/NN or/CC why.<br/NN /><br/NN />Ada/. and/CC Rick's/NN secret/NN marriage/NN is/VB omitted./NN In/IN one/CD episode/NN they/PRP are/VB merely/RB lovers,/VB in/IN the/DT next,/NN people/NN are/VB suddenly/RB referring/VB to/TO them/PRP as/IN husband/NN and/CC wife.<br/NN /><br/VB />Mrs/RP Rouncewell/NN is/VB only/RB introduced/VB at/IN a/DT late/JJ stage/NN in/IN the/DT story/NN and/CC Sargeant/NN George's/NN estrangement/NN from/IN his/PRP$ family/NN is/VB left/VB unexplained/JJ -/. as/RB is/VB the/DT means/NN by/IN which/WH she/PRP is/VB discovered.<br/IN /><br/DT />Tulkinhorn's/NN dedication/NN to/TO maintaining/VB the/DT honour/NN and/CC respectability/NN of/IN the/DT Dedlock/NN family/NN is/VB understated,/NN so/IN his/PRP$ motive/NN for/IN persecuting/DT Lady/NN Dedlock/NN is/VB more/RB obscure/VB than/IN it/PRP need/VB be.<br/IN /><br/DT />The/NN involvement/NN of/IN the/DT brick/NN makers/NN with/IN both/DT Tom/NN and/CC (later)/NN Lady/NN Dedlock/NN is/VB somewhat/RB opaque.<br/VB /><br/DT />It/NN is/VB not/RB obvious/JJ that/IN Guppy/NN renews/VB his/PRP$ offer/NN to/TO Esther/NN because/IN her/PRP$ smallpox/NN scars/NN have/VB all/DT but/CC vanished.<br/NN /><br/NN />This/NN is/VB only/RB a/DT selection:/NN there/EX are/VB others./IN They/PRP are/VB not/RB major/JJ problems/NN and/CC the/DT main/JJ thrust/NN of/IN the/DT story/NN is/VB clear/VB enough./RP Nonetheless,/NN they/PRP are/VB minor/JJ irritations/NN that/IN detract/NN from/IN its/PRP$ power:/NN you/PRP shouldn't/MD have/VB to/TO puzzle/NN over/IN little/JJ plot/NN points./RP However,/NN there/EX are/VB more/RB important/JJ structural/JJ problems/NN that/WH do/VB weaken/VB the/DT story/NN in/IN its/PRP$ later/JJ stages.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT whole/JJ business/NN of/RP Tulkinhorn's/NN murder/NN is/VB somewhat/RB thrown/VB away./RP Bucket/NN immediately/RB pinpoints/RP Hortense/NN as/IN a/DT suspect,/NN which/WH undermines/VB the/DT suspense/NN of/RP Sergeant/NN George's/NN predicament/NN and/CC the/DT importance/NN of/IN finding/VB Mrs/NN Rouncewell./NN It/PRP also/RB diminishes/VB the/DT impact/NN of/IN the/DT sub-plot/NN in/IN which/WH suspicion/NN is/VB thrown/VB on/IN Lady/NN Dedlock/NN and/CC weakens/VB the/DT scene/NN in/IN which/WH Hortense/NN is/VB unmasked/NN in/IN front/NN of/IN Sir/NN Lester.<br/NN /><br/IN />A/DT more/JJ serious/JJ problem/NN is/VB that/IN the/DT murder,/VB its/PRP$ investigation/NN and/CC the/DT subsequent/JJ search/NN for/IN Lady/NN Dedlock,/NN dominate/VB the/DT story/NN for/IN over/IN an/DT hour,/NN during/IN which/WH time/NN we/PRP completely/RB lose/VB sight/NN of/IN the/DT other/JJ main/JJ plot/NN strand:/IN the/DT legal/JJ case/NN and/CC its/PRP$ effect/NN on/RP Rick./NN His/PRP$ failing/VB finances,/IN his/PRP$ gouging/NN by/RP Vholes/NN and/CC Skimpole,/NN Ada's/NN despair,/IN his/PRP$ declining/JJ health/NN and/CC so/RB on,/VB are/VB all/DT put/VB on/IN hold/VB for/IN an/DT entire/JJ episode./IN This/DT may/MD be/VB how/WH Dickens/NN wrote/VB the/DT book/NN (I/NN haven't/NN read/VB it/PRP for/IN years)/NN but/CC a/DT good/JJ screenplay/NN should/MD keep/VB the/DT different/JJ plot/NN strands/NN moving/VB forward/RB together.<br/VB /><br/VB />Finally,/RP Smallweed's/NN role/NN in/IN the/DT story/NN is/VB so/RB diminished/VB that/IN he/PRP is/VB almost/RB superfluous./VB His/PRP$ discovery/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ will,/NN that/WH triggers/VB the/DT final/JJ phase/NN of/IN the/DT story,/NN is/VB also/RB thrown/VB away./IN It/PRP happens/VB off/RP screen.<br/DT /><br/NN />Despite/IN all/DT of/IN this,/VB it/PRP is/VB still/RB a/DT very/RB good/JJ production./NN Many/JJ of/IN the/DT performances/NN are/VB outstanding./DT Individual/JJ scenes/NN are/VB beautifully/TO realised./VB Its/PRP$ accumulating/NN sense/NN of/IN tragedy/NN is/VB very/RB powerful./VB I/PRP would/MD still/RB be/VB recommending/VB it/PRP as/IN a/DT superb/NN adaptation/NN of/IN a/DT great/JJ book,/NN had/VB it/PRP not/RB been/VB for/IN the/DT 2005/CD production./NN In/IN fact,/VB I/PRP probably/RB wouldn't/VB be/VB fully/RB aware/JJ of/IN its/PRP$ defects/NN if/IN I/PRP hadn't/MD seen/VB how/WH Andrew/NN Davies/NN did/VB it/PRP better./VB I/PRP have/VB been/VB critical/JJ of/RP Davies's/NN Jane/NN Austen/NN adaptations,/. but/CC I/PRP have/VB to/TO admit/VB that/IN he/PRP really/RB knows/VB how/WH to/TO tame/JJ Dickens's/NN sprawling/VB books.<br/IN /><br/DT />This/NN is/VB an/DT impressive/JJ and/CC gripping/VB drama/NN and/CC well/RB worth/JJ seven/CD hours/NN of/IN anybody's/VB time./RP Nonetheless,/NN its/PRP$ probable/JJ fate/NN is/VB to/TO be/VB viewed/VB mainly/RB as/IN a/DT cross-reference/NN to/TO the/DT near-definitive/$ 2005/CD version./NN
