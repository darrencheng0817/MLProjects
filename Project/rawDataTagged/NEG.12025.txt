Someone,/NN some/DT day,/NN should/MD do/VB a/DT study/NN of/IN architecture/NN as/IN it/PRP figures/VB in/IN horror/NN films;/NN of/IN all/PDT those/DT explorations/NN of/IN weirdly/NN laid/VB out/RP mansions,/DT searches/NN for/IN secret/JJ passageways/NN and/CC crypts,/NN trackings/NN of/IN monsters/NN through/IN air/NN ducts,/. and/CC so/RB forth./RP Offhand/NN I/PRP can/MD recall/VB only/RB a/DT few/JJ films/NN in/IN which/WH architecture/NN played/VB a/DT major/JJ role/NN throughout--"Demon/RP Seed,"/NN "Cube,"/IN the/DT remake/NN of/RB "Thirteen/RP Ghosts"--but/NN it's/NN at/IN the/DT

and/CC walls./NN So/IN I/PRP was/VB looking/VB forward/RB to/TO this/DT thriller/NN where/WH it/PRP promised/VB to/TO be/VB central./IN The/DT idea/NN is/VB this:/IN An/DT architect/NN has/VB
