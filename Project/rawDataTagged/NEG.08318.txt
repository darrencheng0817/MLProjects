getting/VB their/PRP$ revenge/NN by/IN supernatural/NN means/VB in/IN a/DT relatively/RB straight/RB forward/JJ teen/NN slasher/IN flick./DT We've/NN seen/VB it/PRP all/PDT before,/DT we've/NN seen/VB

the/DT so-called/JJ twist/NN ending/VB which/WH is/VB geared/VB towards/IN leaving/VB things/NN open/VB for/IN a/DT sequel/NN is/VB just/RB lame./VB The/DT film/NN moves/VB along/RP at/IN a/DT
