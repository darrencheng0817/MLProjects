Mobile/NN Suit/NN Gundam/NN Wing/NN is/VB the/DT Fourth/NN series/NN in/IN the/DT continuing/VB Gundam/NN chronicles./NN Unlike/IN the/DT previous/JJ entries/NN which/WH focused/VB on/IN massive/JJ wars,/IN this/DT one/NN is/VB a/DT little/JJ different;/NN instead/RB of/IN having/VB an/DT army-vs.-army/NN situation,/IN this/DT one/NN is/VB led/VB by/IN five/CD teenage/NN boys/NN (due/VB to/TO their/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO blend/VB in/IN more/RB readily/RB than/IN normal/JJ adults)/NN and/CC their/PRP$ machines/NN called/VB "Gundams"/NN because/IN of/IN the/DT metal/NN alloy/NN used/VB in/IN their/PRP$ construction./NN Which/WH leads/VB to/TO problems,/VB since/IN gundams/NN are/VB supposed/VB to/TO be/VB destroyed,/TO replaced/VB by/RP "Mobile/RP Suits",/NN which/WH are/VB piloted/IN less-destructive/DT weapon/NN platforms/NN and/CC "Dolls"/NN which/WH are/VB ran/VB on/RP A.I./NN and/CC are/VB used/VB as/IN grunt/DT infantry.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT whole/JJ point/NN of/IN the/DT series/NN is/VB a/DT metaphysical/JJ question/NN that/WH gives/VB Gundam/NN Wing/NN an/DT edge/NN over/IN a/DT greater/JJ portion/NN of/IN the/DT Anime/NN that/WH makes/VB it's/DT way/NN here./VB Especially/RB since/IN most/JJ anime/NN is/VB adapted/VB from/IN popular/JJ magazines,/NN such/JJ as/RB Naruto,/NN DragonBall,/NN One/PRP Piece,/NN DragonBall/NN Z/NN and/CC InuYasha/NN which/WH are/VB all/DT from/IN Shonen/NN Jump,/NN which/WH is/VB now/RB available/JJ in/RP America.<br/NN /><br/VB />Mobile/RP Suit/NN Gundam/NN Wing/NN sets/VB itself/PRP apart/RB from/IN most/JJ anime/NN in/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN instead/RB of/IN over-the-top/DT battles/NN between/IN mortals/NN who/WH more/RB resemble/VB gods,/RP Gundam/NN is/VB very/RB humanistic/. and/CC seems/VB to/TO revel/VB in/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VB dramatic/JJ instead/RB of/IN melodramatic/NN and/CC events/NN seem/VB to/TO unfold/VB across/IN the/DT series/NN gracefully./VB Normally/RB in/IN anime/NN there/EX are/VB more/RB than/IN few/JJ series/NN that/WH think/VB that/IN the/DT best/JJ way/NN to/TO go/VB about/RB having/VB a/DT "small"/NN battle/NN is/VB to/TO have/VB it/PRP take/VB a/DT half-hour/NN -/. something/NN that/WH would/MD never/RB happen/VB in/IN real/JJ life./RP Gundam/NN tops/VB this/DT by/IN making/VB sure/JJ that/IN everyone/NN knows/VB that/IN characters/NN will/MD die,/VB machines/NN will/MD be/VB destroyed/VB and/CC rebuilt,/NN battles/NN will/MD be/VB lost/VB and/CC won,/NN and/CC it/PRP never/RB seems/VB as/RB though/IN it/PRP makes/VB the/DT actions/NN themselves/PRP satirical.<br/VB /><br/NN />But/IN the/DT magic/JJ of/RP Gundam/NN Wing/NN is/VB in/IN the/DT details,/NN and/CC what/WH this/DT series/NN has/VB that/IN more/JJ anime/NN would/MD be/VB grateful/JJ for/RP having./RP Emotion./NN Instead/RB of/IN mythic/JJ prophecies,/NN magic,/. or/CC overblown/JJ martial/NN arts,/RP Gundam/NN Wing/NN is/VB hard-line/JJ science/NN fiction/NN from/IN a/DT country/NN that/WH hates/VB hard-line/JJ science/NN fiction./NN (NOTE:/IN The/DT author/NN would/MD like/VB to/TO state/NN that/WH Neon/NN Genesis/NN Evangelion/NN is/VB not/RB hard-line-plausible-in-real-life/JJ science/NN fiction/NN due/JJ to/TO the/DT religious/JJ subject/JJ matter/NN that/WH is/VB the/DT core/NN of/IN its/PRP$ series)/NN they/PRP love/VB Star/JJ Wars,/NN but/CC hate/VB A.I./NN (the/VB movie)./RP Henceforth/NN why/WH Gundam/NN Wing/NN was/VB and/CC Gundam/NN SeeD/NN is/VB now/RB in/IN production/NN for/IN both/DT Japanese/JJ and/CC U.S./NN releases/NN at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN with/IN two/CD voice/NN teams./IN American/JJ audiences/NN only/RB have/VB to/TO wait/VB two/CD or/CC three/CD weeks/NN after/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT Japanese/JJ season/NN to/TO catch/VB the/DT dubbed/VB or/CC subtitled/NN versions/NN or/CC even/RB the/DT edited/RP SeeD/NN episodes/NN that/WH air/VB on/RP Cartoon/NN Network.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT emotion/NN is/VB that/IN these/DT two/CD sides/NN that/WH are/VB fighting/VB a/DT war/NN are/VB technically/RB backwards./VB The/DT heroes/NN are/VB those/DT who/WH defend/VB the/DT rights/NN of/IN the/DT more/JJ wealthy/JJ and/CC aristocratic/NN citizens/NN of/IN Earth/NN from/IN the/DT band/NN of/IN terrorists/NN bent/NN on/IN victory/NN at/IN any/DT and/CC all/DT costs/NN that/WH make/VB up/RP the/DT protagonists/NN of/IN Mobile/NN Suit/NN Gundam/NN Wing./NN This/DT is/VB not/RB war,/VB this/DT is/VB "total/NN war"./IN Every/DT person,/NN every/DT building,/NN every/DT street/NN is/VB a/DT target/NN for/IN attack,/NN both/CC on/IN Earth/NN and/CC off.<br/NN /><br/IN />My/DT only/JJ complaint,/NN and/CC the/DT reason/NN it/PRP didn't/MD get/VB the/DT score/NN of/IN ten,/NN is/VB that/IN at/IN about/IN three-fourths/NN of/IN the/DT way/NN through,/. it/PRP just/RB kind/NN of/IN goes/VB dead/JJ for/IN a/DT few/JJ episodes,/NN and/CC no/DT one/NN really/RB seems/VB to/TO change./VB Kind/NN of/IN like/IN a/DT present-time/NN flashback,/. which/WH is/VB fine/JJ due/JJ to/TO what/WH it/PRP reveals/VB about/IN the/DT characters,/NN but/CC at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN it/PRP drags/VB down/RP what/WH should/MD be/VB the/DT brewing/NN between/IN Project:/NN Meteor/NN and/CC OZ./NN But/CC the/DT final/JJ two/CD episodes/NN and/CC the/DT overplayed-on-Cartoon-Network/NN (back/VB in/RP
