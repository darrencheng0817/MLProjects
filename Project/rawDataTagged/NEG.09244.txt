Chillers/NN starts/VB on/IN a/DT cold,/JJ dark/JJ stormy/JJ night/NN as/IN a/DT bus/NN drops/VB off/RP three/CD passenger's/NN outside/IN a/DT bus/NN station,/IN a/DT young/JJ boy/NN named/VB Mason/NN (Jesse/RP Emery),/NN a/DT college/NN professor/NN Dr./NN Howard/RP Conrow/NN (David/RP Wohl)/NN &/CC a/DT woman/NN named/VB Sharon/NN Phillips/NN (Laurie/RP Pennington)./NN Inside/IN they/PRP

a/DT camping/NN trip...<br/IN /><br/DT />Then/NN it's/NN Sharon/NN whose/WH$ story/NN revolves/NN around/IN a/DT newsman/NN named/VB Tom/NN Williams/NN (Thom/RP Delventhal)/NN who/WH she/PRP phones/NN up,/NN in/IN no/DT time/NN at/IN all/DT Tom/NN is/VB at/IN her/PRP$ front/JJ door/NN but/CC he/PRP actually/RB turns/VB out/RP to/TO be/VB a/FW Vampire...<br/NN /><br/VB />It's/RP Ronnie's/NN turn/VB

last/JJ (predictable)/NN twist...<br/IN /><br/DT />Written,/NN produced/VB &/CC directed/VB by/IN Daniel/NN Boyd/NN Chillers/NN is/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT worst/JJ horror/NN anthologies/RP I've/NN ever/RB seen/VB &/CC I/PRP usually/RB really/RB like/IN this/DT sub-genre./NN The/DT script/NN by/IN Boyd/NN lacks/VB what/WH is/VB needed/VB for/IN films/NN such/JJ as/RB Chillers/NN to/TO work,/VB you/PRP can/MD see/VB the/DT final/JJ twist/NN coming/VB a/DT mile/NN off/RP &/CC each/DT story/NN is/VB really/RB lame./VB The/DT first/JJ one/NN is/VB totally/RB pointless/. &/CC didn't/NN seem/VB to/TO have/VB an/DT ending/NN &/CC the/DT best/JJ thing/NN about/IN these/DT anthologies/NN are/VB the/DT short/JJ snappy/NN stories/NN that/WH are/VB rounded/VB off/RP with/IN a/DT neat/JJ twist./IN The/DT second/JJ story/NN is/VB predictable/JJ &,/NN again,/VB just/RB ends/VB without/IN any/DT payoff./NN So/IN it/PRP continues/VB throughout/IN Chillers/NN that/IN each/DT story/NN is/VB deeply/RB unsatisfying/VB to/TO watch/VB &/CC have/VB no/DT reward/NN for/IN doing/VB so./IN The/DT character's/NN &/CC dialogue/NN are/VB poorly/RB written,/VB the/DT stories/NN seem/VB to/TO have/VB no/DT original/JJ ideas/NN of/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ &/CC as/IN a/DT whole/JJ the/DT film/NN totally/RB sucks./VB At/IN least/JJ each/DT story/NN doesn't/IN last/JJ long/JJ &/CC I/PRP liked/VB the/DT idea/NN behind/IN the/DT linking/VB segments.<br/IN /><br/DT />Director/NN Boyd/NN was/VB obviously/RB working/VB with/IN a/DT very/RB low/JJ budget/NN &/CC it/PRP shows./VB All/DT I/PRP can/MD say/VB is/VB if/IN you/PRP want/VB to/TO watch/VB a/DT 15/CD odd/JJ minute/JJ short/JJ story/NN set/VB entirely/RB within/IN a/DT swimming/NN pool/NN then/RB Chillers/NN is/VB for/IN you./IN The/DT stories/NN are/VB neither/DT clever,/JJ scary/JJ or/CC have/VB any/DT sort/NN of/IN tension/NN or/CC build/VB up/RP to/TO anything./VB Having/VB said/VB that/IN it/PRP does/VB have/VB a/DT few/JJ nice/JJ scenes/NN &/CC some/DT surprising/JJ competence/NN shines/NN through/IN on/RB occasion./RP Violence/NN &/CC gore/VB wise/JJ there/EX isn't/VB much/RB happening/VB in/RP Chillers,/NN a/DT ripped/VB out/RP heart,/IN a/DT decapitated/NN head/NN &/CC a/DT bitten/NN off/IN hand/NN is/VB as/IN gory/NN as/IN it/PRP gets.<br/MD /><br/VB />Technically/RP Chillers/NN is/VB poor/JJ stuff/NN that/IN won't/NN impress/VB anyone./RP Basic/NN cinematography,/IN bad/JJ music,/NN cheap/JJ special/JJ effects/NN &/CC below/IN average/JJ production/NN values./RP Chillers/NN also/RB features/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT worst/JJ closing/NN theme/NN songs/NN ever,/NN period./IN The/DT acting/NN is/VB also/RB of/IN a/DT very/RB low/JJ standard.<br/NN /><br/NN />I/NN am/VB sure/RB a/DT lot/NN of/IN effort/NN was/VB put/VB into/IN Chillers/NN as/IN a/DT low/JJ budget/NN film/NN &/CC at/IN least/JJ the/DT filmmakers/NN tried/VB so/RB I/PRP will/MD give/VB credit/NN for/IN that/DT at/IN least,/NN but/CC that/WH still/RB doesn't/VB stop/VB me/PRP from/IN thinking/NN it's/IN crap./DT Similar/JJ anthology/NN films/NN like/VB Tales/NN From/IN the/DT Crypt/NN (1972),/RP Asylum/NN (1972),/IN The/DT Vault/NN of/RP Horror/NN (1973),/NN Dr./NN Terror's/NN House/NN of/RP Horrors/NN (1965),/RP Creepshow/NN (1982)/. &/CC Tales/NN From/IN the/DT Darkside:/NN The/DT Movie/NN (1990)/NN are/VB far/RB
