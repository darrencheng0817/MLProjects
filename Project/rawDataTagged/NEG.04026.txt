I'm/NN not/RB a/DT huge/JJ Freddy/NN Krueger/NN fan,but/. that/WH doesn't/MD mean/VB that/IN I/PRP don't/VB like/IN Robert/NN Englund/NN and/CC his/PRP$ other/JJ Nightmare/NN on/RP Elm/NN Street/NN movies.I/NN think/VB that/IN Robert/NN is/VB a/DT very/RB good/JJ actor.Nobody/NN plays/VB a/DT better/RB Freddy/NN Krueger/NN than/IN he/PRP does.But,no/VB offense/NN Robert,/NN this/DT movie/NN sucked.The/NN acting/VB is/VB terrible,the/DT plot/NN is/VB really/RB weak,and/RP Freddy/NN Krueger/NN is/VB the/DT only/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT cast/NN that's/VB even/RB worth/JJ watching.Sometimes/NN sequels/NN can/MD be/VB better/RB than/IN the/DT first,such/NN as/IN the/DT Friday/NN the/DT 13th/JJ franchise(I/NN thought/VB the/DT remake/NN was/VB the/DT best/JJ in/IN the/DT series.)But/NN this/DT isn't/$ one/CD of/IN those/DT movies.The/NN original/NN was/VB good,the/DT 2nd/NN in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN was/VB better,the/DT 3rd/NN was/VB okay/JJ but/CC I/PRP haven,t/MD seen/VB the/DT others.Whatever/NN you/PRP do,don,t/MD make/VB the/DT same/JJ mistake/NN I/PRP did/VB by/IN watching/VB this/DT piece/NN of/IN crap./DT
