this/DT animated/RP Inspector/NN Gadget/NN movie/NN is/VB pretty/RB lame.the/JJ story/NN is/VB very/RB weak,and/. there/EX is/VB little/JJ action.most/NN of/IN the/DT characters/NN are/VB given/VB little/JJ to/TO nothing/NN to/TO do.the/VB movie/NN is/VB mildly/RB entertaining/JJ at/IN best,but/NN really/RB doesn't/VB go/VB any/DT where/WH and/CC is/VB pointless.it's/DT watchable/NN but/CC only/RB just/RB and/CC is/VB nowhere/RB near/IN the/DT calibre/NN of/IN the/DT animated/NN TV/NN show/VB from/IN the/DT 80's.it's/NN not/RB a/DT movie/NN that/WH bears/VB repeat/VB viewing,at/DT least/JJ in/IN my/PRP$ mind.it's/NN only/RB about/IN 74/CD minutes/NN long/RB including/VB credits,so/DT i/FW guess/VB that's/IN a/DT good/JJ thing.unlike/NN in/IN the/DT TV/NN show,the/NN characters/NN are/VB not/RB worth/JJ rooting/VB for/IN here.in/IN the/DT show,you/NN wanted/VB Inspector/NN Gadget/NN to/TO save/VB the/DT day,but/NN there,who/VB really/RB cares?anyway,that's/VB just/RB my/PRP$ opinion.for/NN me/FW Inspector/NN Gadget's/NN Last/JJ Case/NN is/VB a/DT disappointing/JJ 3/10/NN
