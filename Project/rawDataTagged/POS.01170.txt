"Maléfique"/PRP is/VB an/DT example/NN of/IN how/WH a/DT horror/NN film/NN can/MD be/VB effective/JJ with/IN nothing/NN more/RB than/IN a/DT well-executed/NN plot/NN and/CC a/DT lot/NN of/IN heart./VB Its/PRP$ cast/NN doesn't/NN have/VB recognized/VB names,/IN it/PRP doesn't/MD have/VB a/DT big/JJ budget/NN and/CC it/PRP certainly/RB lacks/VB in/IN the/DT visual/JJ effects/NN aspect;/. but/CC it/PRP compensates/VB all/PDT that/DT with/IN an/DT intelligent/JJ and/CC well-written/NN script,/IN an/DT effective/JJ cast/NN and/CC the/DT vision/NN of/IN a/DT director/NN focused/VB more/RB on/IN telling/VB the/DT story/NN than/IN in/IN delivering/VB cheap/JJ thrills./NN Eric/NN Valette/NN may/MD not/RB be/VB a/DT well-know/NN name/NN yet,/. but/CC with/IN "Maléfique",/VB his/PRP$ feature/NN length/NN debut,/. he/PRP proves/VB he/PRP is/VB at/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN contemporaries/NN like/VB Jeunet,/NN Gans/NN or/CC Aja.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT film/NN is/VB the/DT story/NN of/IN four/CD prisoners/NN in/IN a/DT cell,/$ four/CD different/JJ men/NN with/IN very/RB different/JJ backgrounds/NN but/CC with/IN one/CD single/JJ goal:/NN to/TO get/VB out./RP Carrère/NN (Gérald/RP Laroche)/NN gets/VB imprisoned/VB after/IN being/VB declared/VB guilty/JJ of/IN a/DT multi-millionaire/NN fraud;/IN his/PRP$ cell-mates,/NN the/DT violent/JJ Marcus/NN (Clovis/RP Cornillac),/NN the/DT

using/VB black/JJ magic.<br/NN /><br/NN />Written/VB by/RP Alexandre/NN Charlo/NN and/CC Franck/NN Magnier,/NN "Maléfique"/NN is/VB a/DT great/JJ mix/NN of/IN dark/JJ fantasy/NN and/CC horror/NN in/IN a/DT way/NN very/RB reminiscent/JJ of/RP Clive/NN Barker's/NN stories./IN The/DT movie's/JJ strongest/JJ point/NN is/VB the/DT way/NN it/PRP builds/VB up/RP the/DT characters,/NN they/PRP are/VB all/DT have/VB very/RB complex/JJ and/CC different/JJ personalities/NN and/CC a/DT lot/NN of/IN the/DT tension/NN and/CC suspense/NN comes/VB from/IN their/PRP$ constant/JJ clash/NN of/IN personalities./IN The/DT story's/NN supernatural/NN element/NN is/VB very/RB well-handled/. and/CC overall/RB gives/VB the/DT film/NN the/DT feeling/NN of/IN reading/NN a/FW Gothic/NN novel./NN Despite/IN being/VB a/DT movie/NN about/IN four/CD men/NN locked/VB in/IN a/DT room,/NN the/DT movie/NN never/RB gets/VB boring/JJ or/CC tiresome/JJ and/CC in/IN fact,/IN the/DT isolation/NN of/IN the/DT group/NN increases/VB the/DT feeling/NN of/IN distrust,/DT claustrophobia,/NN and/CC specially,/NN paranoia.<br/IN /><br/DT />Director/NN Eric/NN Valette/NN makes/VB a/DT great/JJ use/NN of/IN atmosphere,/DT mood/NN and/CC his/PRP$ cast/NN to/TO give/VB life/NN to/TO the/DT plot./NN Despite/IN its/PRP$ obvious/JJ lack/NN of/IN budget,/VB he/PRP has/VB crafted/VB a/DT brilliant/JJ film/NN that/WH feels/VB original,/DT fresh/JJ and/CC very/RB attractive./VB His/PRP$ subtle/JJ and/CC effective/JJ camera-work/NN helps/VB to/TO make/VB the/DT film/NN dynamic/NN despite/IN its/PRP$ single/JJ location,/NN and/CC the/DT slow/JJ pace/NN the/DT film/NN unfolds/VB is/VB excellent/JJ to/TO create/VB the/DT heavy/JJ atmosphere/NN of/IN isolation/NN and/CC distrust/VB the/DT movie/NN bases/VB its/PRP$ plot./NN The/DT very/RB few/JJ displays/NN of/IN special/JJ effects/NN are/VB very/RB well-done/. and/CC Valette/NN trades/NN quantity/NN for/IN quality/NN in/IN the/DT few/JJ but/CC terrific/JJ scenes/NN of/IN gore.<br/DT /><br/NN />The/NN characters/NN are/VB what/WH make/VB this/DT film/NN work,/. and/CC the/DT cast/NN definitely/RB deserves/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT credit./RP Gérald/NN Laroche/NN is/VB excellent/JJ as/RB Carrère,/NN a/DT man/NN at/IN first/JJ sight/NN innocent,/. but/CC who/WH hides/VB a/DT dark/JJ past./NN Philippe/NN Laudenbach/NN and/CC Dimitri/NN Rataud/NN are/VB very/RB effective/JJ too,/NN specially/RB Rataud/NN in/IN his/PRP$ very/RB demanding/VB role./RP However,/NN is/VB Clovis/NN Cornillac/NN who/WH steal/VB the/DT show/NN with/IN his/PRP$ performance/NN as/RB Marcus,/NN a/DT violent/JJ and/CC disturbed/VB man/NN who/WH deep/RB inside/RB only/RB wants/VB to/TO be/VB himself./IN The/DT characters/NN are/VB superbly/TO developed/VB and/CC the/DT cast/NN makes/VB the/DT most/JJ of/IN them.<br/DT /><br/NN />The/NN movie/NN is/VB terrific,/NN but/CC it/PRP is/VB not/RB without/IN its/PRP$ share/NN of/IN flaws./NN Of/IN course,/IN the/DT most/JJ notorious/JJ one/NN is/VB its/PRP$ the/NN low-budget./IN Some/DT of/IN the/DT CGI-effects/NN are/VB a/DT bit/NN poor/NN compared/VB to/TO the/DT effective/JJ make-up/NN and/CC prosthetics/NN used/VB in/IN other/JJ scenes,/NN however,/. it/PRP is/VB never/RB too/RB bad/JJ for/IN it./NN Probably/RB the/DT bad/JJ thing/NN about/IN "Maléfique"/NN is/VB that/IN it/PRP seems/VB to/TO lose/VB some/DT steam/NN by/IN the/DT end/NN when/WH it/PRP focuses/VB on/IN the/DT supernatural/JJ black/JJ magic/NN rather/RB than/IN in/IN the/DT characters,/NN not/RB too/RB much/RB of/IN a/DT bad/JJ thing/NN but/CC the/DT ending/NN may/MD seem/VB weak/JJ from/IN that/DT point/NN of/IN view.<br/DT /><br/NN />Anyways,/NN "Maléfique"/NN is/VB another/DT one/CD of/IN those/DT
