John/NN Cassavetes'/NN "Opening/RP Night"/NN is/VB fantastic/JJ and/CC fascinating;/DT fantastic/JJ because/IN it/PRP plays/VB with/IN the/DT deepest/JJ fears/NN we/PRP have/VB inside/IN our/PRP$ imagination,/JJ fascinating/JJ because/IN it/PRP never/RB ceases/VB surprising/JJ us./NN With/IN its/PRP$ very/RB long/JJ duration/NN of/IN two/CD hours/NN and/CC twenty/CD minutes,/NN anyone/NN who/WH appreciates/VB characters/NN won't/NN be/VB able/JJ to/TO take/VB their/PRP$ eyes/NN off/IN the/DT screen.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT story/NN of/IN an/DT unstable/JJ actress,/NN Myrtle/NN Gordon,/NN (Gena/RP Rowlands)/NN trying/VB to/TO put/VB herself/PRP together/RB for/IN a/DT play,/NN fighting/VB her/PRP demons;/VB "Opening/RP Night"/NN is/VB not/RB only/RB about/IN a/DT woman/NN on/IN the/DT verge/NN of/IN a/DT breakdown/NN but/CC also/RB about/IN the/DT complexities/NN of/IN the/DT lives/NN of/IN theater/NN actors/NN and/CC the/DT theatrical/JJ world./IN All/DT of/RP Cassavetes'/NN characters/NN here/RB are/VB experienced/JJ people/NN that/WH know/VB about/IN the/DT world/NN of/IN theater;/NN so/IN half/NN of/IN the/DT film/NN takes/VB place/NN on/IN a/DT stage,/NN either/CC where/WH the/DT performers/NN do/VB their/PRP$ job/NN or/CC at/IN backstage,/NN where/WH producers/NN and/CC writers/NN and/CC directors/NN do/VB their/PRP$ job.<br/NN /><br/NN />Cassavetes/NN is/VB so/RB harsh/JJ with/IN his/PRP$ characters/NN that/IN this/DT unkindness/NN turns/VB towards/IN the/DT audience,/NN but/CC the/DT audience/NN in/IN the/DT cinema./NN Because/IN there/EX is/VB another/DT audience,/NN in/IN the/DT theater/NN of/IN the/DT film,/NN that/IN doesn't/NN know/VB what/WH is/VB really/RB happening/VB and/CC laugh/NN because/IN they/PRP think/VB everything/NN is/VB performance./NN And/CC that's/VB essentially/RB what/WH it/PRP is;/MD it's/VB just/RB that/IN the/DT audience/NN in/IN the/DT theater/NN doesn't/NN get/VB to/TO see/VB 'backstage'/IN the/DT way/NN we/PRP do./VB They/PRP don't/MD experience/VB Gena/NN Rowlands'/NN exuberance/NN before/IN she/PRP goes/VB out/RP to/TO that/DT stage,/NN but/CC most/RB importantly;/VB they/PRP don't/MD know/VB the/DT reasons/NN why/WH she/PRP acts/VB the/DT way/NN she/PRP does.<br/VB /><br/TO />I/VB always/RB thought/VB that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB difficult/JJ to/TO be/VB friends/NN with/IN an/DT actor./NN Myrtle/NN (Rowland)/NN says/VB she's/IN an/DT actress/NN and/CC that's/VB the/DT only/JJ thing/NN she/PRP knows/VB how/WH to/TO do;/NN and/CC I/PRP imagine/VB that/IN if/IN I/PRP had/VB a/DT friend/NN who/WH was/VB a/DT professional/JJ performer,/. it/PRP would/MD be/VB really/RB difficult/JJ to/TO tell/VB when/WH he's/MD saying/VB the/DT truth/NN because/IN I/PRP would/MD know/VB he's/IN an/DT actor/NN and/CC he/PRP can/MD fake/JJ anything/NN at/IN any/DT time./NN A/DT lot/NN of/IN the/DT things/NN that/IN Myrtle/NN does/VB during/IN the/DT awful/JJ experiences/NN the/DT film/NN puts/VB her/PRP$ throughWe/NN suspect/VB if/IN she's/NN being/VB real;/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT characters/NN suspect/VB too.<br/IN /><br/DT />There/NN is/VB the/DT writer,/NN Sarah/NN (Joan/RP Blondell),/NN who/WH can't/MD understand/VB why/WH Myrtle/NN doesn't/NN understand/VB the/DT character/NN she's/NN written/VB for/RP her./RP There's/NN the/DT director,/RP Manny/NN (Ben/RP Gazzara),/NN who/WH can't/MD accept/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN his/PRP$ best/JJ actress/NN might/MD be/VB losing/VB it;/IN the/DT producer/NN David/NN (Paul/RP Stewart)/NN who/WH doesn't/MD know/VB where/WH to/TO stand/VB and/CC Myrtle's/NN co-star/NN Maurice/NN (Cassavetes/NN himself),/. who/WH can't/VB deal/NN with/IN the/DT love/NN they/PRP have/VB for/IN each/DT other.<br/NN /><br/NN />When/. she/PRP witnesses/NN the/DT death/NN of/IN a/DT teenager,/NN a/DT fan;/NN all/RB of/IN this/DT comes/VB together/RB and/CC affects/VB Myrtle,/NN but/CC no/DT one/NN knows/VB if/IN her/PRP$ delusions/NN are/VB for/IN real./VB They/PRP don't/MD say/VB anything/NN because/IN they/PRP don't/MD want/VB to/TO upset/VB her,/NN but/CC the/DT movie/NN enters/VB in/IN a/DT state/NN of/IN subconsciousness/NN that/IN only/JJ Myrtle/NN accepts./NN At/IN times,/VB we/PRP can/MD tell/VB that/IN everyone/NN has/VB had/VB it./NN During/IN these/DT moments,/RP Cassavetes'/NN brilliant/JJ script/NN depicts/VB a/DT scary/JJ brutal/JJ honesty/NN in/IN the/DT words/NN the/DT characters/NN say/VB in/IN a/DT discussion/NN backstage;/. and/CC not/RB only/RB what/WH everyone/NN tells/VB Myrtle/NN but/CC also/RB what/WH she/PRP says/VB to/TO them.<br/VB /><br/DT />Here/NN are/VB people/NN who/WH are/VB not/RB afraid/JJ to/TO speak/VB their/PRP$ mind/NN and/CC constantly/RB change/VB what/WH they/PRP are/VB thinking,/VB just/RB like/VB Cassavetes'/NN way/NN of/IN making/VB cinema./NN And/CC in/IN this/DT aspect,/NN the/DT performances/NN are/VB more/RB important/JJ here/RB than/IN in/IN "Shadows",/NN because/IN the/DT characters/NN are/VB involved/VB in/IN a/DT bigger/JJ picture;/IN a/DT bigger/JJ story/NN that/WH steps/VB out/RP of/IN the/DT trivial.<br/NN /><br/NN />But/NN in/IN another/DT aspect,/NN the/DT actual/JJ way/NN of/IN making/VB cinema,/IN this/DT movie/NN is/VB no/DT different/JJ from/IN "Shadows"./TO There's/NN a/DT beautiful/JJ thing/NN in/IN the/DT way/NN Al/NN Ruban's/NN camera/NN shoots/VB the/DT characters./NN When/WH someone's/VB talking,/IN the/DT camera/NN doesn't/NN focus/VB on/IN him,/VB it/PRP shoots/VB the/DT person/NN

sometimes/RB they/PRP are/VB happy,/VB sometimes/RB devastated.<br/VB /><br/DT />Improvisation/NN might/MD still/RB be/VB there,/DT though,/NN among/IN all/PDT these/DT wonderful/JJ performances./NN Near/IN the/DT end,/NN there's/IN an/DT unexpected/JJ scene/NN where/WH Cassavetes/NN and/CC Rowlands/NN start/VB talking,/DT non-stop./NN Whether/IN this/DT was/VB improvised/NN or/CC not/RB is/VB
