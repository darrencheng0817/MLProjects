Polish/JJ film/NN maker/NN Walerian/NN Borowczyk's/NN La/NN Bête/NN (French,/RP 1975,/CD aka/IN The/DT Beast)/NN is/VB among/IN the/DT most/JJ controversial/JJ and/CC brave/NN films/NN ever/RB made/VB and/CC a/DT very/RB excellent/JJ one/CD too./IN This/DT film/NN tells/VB everything/NN that's/VB generally/RB been/VB hidden/JJ and/CC denied/VB about/IN our/PRP$ nature/NN and/CC our/PRP$ sexual/JJ nature/NN in/IN particular/JJ with/IN the/DT symbolism/NN and/CC silence/NN of/IN its/PRP$ images./NN The/DT images/NN may/MD look/VB wild,/IN perverse,/DT "sick"/NN or/CC exciting,/NN but/CC they/PRP are/VB all/DT in/IN relation/NN with/IN the/DT lastly/VB mentioned./RP Sex,/NN desire/NN and/CC death/NN are/VB very/RB strong/JJ and/CC primary/JJ things/NN and/CC dominate/VB all/PDT the/DT flesh/NN that/WH has/VB a/DT human/JJ soul/NN inside/RB it./VB They/PRP interest/NN and/CC temptate/VB us/PRP so/RB powerfully/JJ (and/NN by/IN our/PRP$ nature)/NN that/IN they/PRP are/VB considered/VB scary,/DT unacceptable/JJ and/CC something/NN too/RB wild/JJ to/TO be/VB true.<br/DT /><br/NN />/IN A/DT sophisticated/JJ young/JJ woman/NN travels/VB with/IN her/PRP$ mother/NN to/TO a/DT French/JJ countryside/NN to/TO meet/VB her/PRP$ soon-to-become/NN husband/NN whom/WH with/IN she/PRP has/VB had/VB a/DT letter/NN affair/NN of/IN some/DT kind./NN All/RB are/VB very/RB exciting/JJ and/CC each/DT others'/NN parents/NN and/CC relatives/NN wait/VB impatiently/VB to/TO see/VB the/DT new/JJ people/NN arriving/VB to/TO their/PRP$ families./NN The/DT innocence/NN of/IN the/DT young/JJ

all/PDT its/PRP$ humans/NN and/CC animals,/NN and/CC a/DT mysterious/NN "la/NN bête"/. that/WH turns/VB out/RP to/TO be/VB something/NN that/IN the/DT characters,/NN nor/CC most/RB of/IN the/DT film's/NN audience,/NN could/MD have/VB never/RB imagined/VB to/TO be/VB real/JJ and/CC (in/DT front/JJ of)/NN them.<br/IN /><br/DT />The/NN film/NN is/VB about/IN the/DT same/JJ theme/NN as/IN Canadian/JJ David/NN Cronenberg's/NN debyt/NN feature/VB Shivers/NN (1975),/. which/WH happens/VB inside/IN a/DT huge/JJ luxury/NN building/NN in/IN which/WH destructive/JJ and/CC gory/NN parasites/NN

of/IN instincts./DT Human/NN has/VB instincts/NN that/WH can/MD be/VB and/CC are/VB stronger/JJ than/IN his/PRP$ will/NN and/CC that/WH is/VB why/WH those/DT instincts/NN can/MD be/VB as/IN

is/VB not/RB always/RB used/VB too/RB much/RB as/RB can/MD be/VB seen/VB anywhere/RB around/RB us./VB The/DT film/NN opens/VB greatly,/NN and/CC very/RB shockingly/VB for/IN most/JJ hypocritic/NN attitudes,/NN showing/VB a/DT horny/JJ male/JJ horse/NN raging/VB in/IN fury/NN as/IN he/PRP waits/VB to/TO get/VB inside/IN the/DT mare/NN and/CC continue/VB the/DT race,/NN but/CC the/DT rage/NN and/CC visible/JJ lust/. we/PRP see/VB from/IN his/PRP$ eyes/NN and/CC violent/JJ movements/NN are/VB the/DT key/JJ elements/NN of/IN that/DT beginning/NN and/CC why/WH it/PRP is/VB there,/VB not/RB the/DT close-ups/NN of/IN organs/NN as/RB could/MD be/VB so/RB easily/RB claimed./VB The/DT horse/NN is/VB a/DT beast/NN that/IN battles/NN in/IN an/DT almost/RB unbearable/JJ heat,/NN in/IN heat/NN that's/VB much/RB stronger/JJ than/IN his/PRP$ will/NN as/IN he/PRP doesn't/MD have/VB any/DT control/NN at/IN that/DT point/NN anymore./IN The/DT power/NN of/IN the/DT instinct/NN makes/VB an/DT

age/NN groups/NN inside/IN it/PRP from/IN the/DT little/JJ innocent/JJ children/NN waiting/VB to/TO grow/VB up/RP and/CC develop/VB to/TO their/PRP$ blossom,/NN to/TO the/DT adults/NN and/CC elders/NN that/IN all/DT represent/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT lifespan,/NN creating/VB the/DT face/NN of/IN human/JJ life/NN on/IN screen./IN A/DT film/NN doesn't/VB necessarily/RB need/VB more/JJ characters/NN this/DT way/NN as/IN all/PDT the/DT important/JJ ones/NN are/VB already/RB there/RB and/CC represent/VB the/DT whole/JJ race,/NN including/VB the/DT urban/JJ and/CC countryside/NN inhabitants,/. and/CC both/DT sexes./NN The/DT mansion/NN makes/VB the/DT protagonist/NN girl's/IN sexuality/DT wake/NN as/IN she/PRP saws/VB the/DT horses/NN coupling/NN and/CC acting/VB like/IN she/PRP obviously/RB has/VB never/RB thought/VB of./NN For/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN she/PRP sees/VB something/NN unique/JJ and/CC something/NN that/IN excites/NN and/CC feels/VB almost/RB vital/JJ for/IN her/PRP and/CC her/PRP$ body,/NN like/IN getting/VB water/NN when/WH you're/VB very/RB thirsty./VB The/DT transformation/NN of/IN the/DT girl/NN is/VB a/DT very/RB important/JJ element/NN in/IN the/DT film/NN as/IN she/PRP has/VB lived/VB unaware/JJ of/IN these/DT things/NN inside/IN her,/NN with/IN his/PRP$ mother/NN and/CC camera/NN and/CC a/DT letter-boyfriend,/NN even/RB though/IN the/DT things/NN have/VB just/RB waited/VB for/IN the/DT moment/NN to/TO burst/VB out./RP Flesh/NN desires/NN flesh/NN and/CC that/WH belongs/VB to/TO being/VB a/DT humanimal,/NN but/CC still/RB those/DT things/NN are/VB not/RB so/RB easily/RB admitted/VB everywhere/RB and/CC films/NN like/IN these/DT trying/VB to/TO depict/VB it/PRP get/VB banned/VB for/RP

/><br/NN />The/IN film's/DT last/JJ 30/CD minutes/NN are/VB also/RB as/IN important/JJ as/IN the/DT beginning,/NN and/CC once/RB again/RB show/VB how/WH powerful/JJ cinema/NN is/VB without/IN

about/IN the/DT mysterious/NN beast/NN that/WH turns/VB out/RP to/TO be/VB none/NN other/JJ than/IN the/DT undressed/NN form/NN of/IN ourselves,/NN having/VB lived/VB in/IN the/DT woods/NN without/IN other/JJ people/beasts/NN near/IN him./IN The/DT dream/NN sequence/NN is/VB the/DT one/CD that/IN causes/NN and/CC caused/VB most/RB of/IN the/DT controversy/NN alongside/IN the/DT film's/JJ overall/JJ straight/JJ and/CC honest/JJ attitude,/NN and/CC the/DT images/NN are/VB so/RB easy/JJ to/TO be/VB judged/VB as/IN "perverse"/NN and/CC "pornographic",/NN without/IN a/DT courage/NN to/TO go/VB deeper/RB into/IN them,/DT character/NN reactions/NN and/CC thoughts/NN behind/IN what/WH we/PRP see./VB The/DT images/NN are/VB exciting/JJ in/IN her/PRP$ dream/NN and/CC also/RB eventually/RB inside/IN the/DT dream/NN for/IN the/DT dream's/NN (more)/IN human/JJ character,/NN and/CC Borowczyk/NN forces/NN us/PRP to/TO admit/VB it/PRP with/IN the/DT images/NN that/WH are/VB so/RB close/VB to/TO a/DT "normal"/JJ sexual/JJ act/NN between/IN a/DT man/NN and/CC a/DT female,/NN which/WH is/VB a/DT beautiful/JJ thing/NN and/CC expression/NN of/IN love,/IN another/DT human/JJ need./NN Also/RB the/DT numerous,/NN and/CC cleverly/RB blackly/VB humorous/DT love/NN making/VB scenes/NN inside/IN the/DT mansion,/NN between/IN the/DT young/JJ mother/NN and/CC the/DT black/JJ servant,/NN get/VB interrupted/VB many/JJ times/NN as/IN someone/NN screams/NN for/IN the/DT servant,/NN for/IN example,/NN and/CC there's/VB no/DT doubt/NN that/IN the/DT sensual/JJ image/NN of/IN two/CD young/JJ human/JJ bodies/NN being/VB together/RB and/CC being/VB interrupted/VB with/IN an/DT angry/JJ shout/NN at/IN least/JJ doesn't/NN become/VB any/DT more/JJ pleasant/JJ by/IN the/DT interruption./RP Borowczyk/NN has/VB managed/VB to/TO paint/VB his/PRP$ images/NN so/RB beautiful/JJ and/CC "sensitive"/NN that/IN his/PRP$ message/NN is/VB almost/RB impossible/JJ to/TO be/VB misunderstood,/NN but/CC nothing/NN seems/VB to/TO be/VB impossible/JJ for/IN our/PRP$ cultures/NN and/CC minds/NN that/WH criticize/VB art./IN He/PRP uses/VB dialogue/NN only/RB when/WH it's/MD necessary,/VB otherwise/RB the/DT images/NN do/VB the/DT job/NN and/CC make/VB the/DT film/NN powerful.<br/IN /><br/DT />Death/NN is/VB also/RB there,/VB as/IN flesh/NN dies/VB sooner/RB or/CC later,/NN after/IN years/NN of/IN life/NN and/CC instincts,/VB it/PRP dies./VB The/DT ending/VB is/VB inevitable/JJ but/CC the/DT meaning/NN of/IN the/DT dream/NN sequence/NN could/MD have/VB also/RB been/VB as/IN powerful/JJ without/IN the/DT kind/NN of/IN dramatic/JJ and/CC "revealing"/NN ending/VB too./IN Another/DT blackly/NN humorous/NN element/NN comes/VB when/WH we/PRP see/VB the/DT shocked/JJ city/NN women/NN running/VB out/RP of/IN the/DT place/NN in/IN which/WH they/PRP saw/VB a/DT little/JJ more/JJ than/IN they/PRP were/VB looking/VB for!/IN They/PRP visited/VB the/DT mansion/NN of/IN truth/NN about/IN

comments.<br/NN /><br/IN />Borowczyk's/DT film/NN is/VB also/RB very/RB beautiful/JJ visually/RB alongside/IN its/PRP$ raw/JJ honesty,/NN and/CC the/DT nature/NN and/CC forest/NN have/VB rarely/RB
