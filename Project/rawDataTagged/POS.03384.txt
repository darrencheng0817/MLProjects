I/PRP caught/VB Evening/NN in/IN the/DT cinema/NN with/IN a/DT lady/NN friend./RP Evening/NN is/VB a/DT chick/NN flick/NN with/IN no/DT apologies/NN for/IN being/VB such,/NN but/CC I/PRP can/MD say/VB with/IN some/DT relief/NN that/WH it's/VB not/RB so/RB infused/VB with/IN estrogen/NN that/IN it's/DT painful/JJ for/IN a/DT red-blooded/JJ male/JJ to/TO watch./VB Except/IN for/IN a/DT single/JJ instance/NN at/IN the/DT very/JJ end/NN of/IN the/DT movie,/NN I/PRP watched/VB with/IN interest/NN and/CC did/VB not/RB have/VB to/TO turn/VB away/RP or/CC roll/VB my/PRP$ eyes/NN at/IN any/DT self-indulgent/JJ melodrama./RP Ladies,/NN for/IN their/PRP$ part,/NN will/MD absolutely/RB love/VB this/DT movie.<br/NN /><br/IN />Ann/DT Lord/NN is/VB elderly,/DT bed-ridden/NN and/CC spending/VB her/PRP$ last/JJ few/JJ days/NN on/IN Earth/NN as/IN comfortably/NN as/IN possible/JJ in/IN her/PRP$ own/JJ home/NN with/IN her/PRP$ two/CD grown/JJ daughters/NN at/IN her/PRP side./RP Discomfited/NN by/IN the/DT memories/NN of/IN her/PRP$ past,/NN Ann/NN suddenly/RB calls/VB out/RP a/DT man's/NN name/VB her/PRP$ daughters/NN have/VB never/RB heard/VB before:/RP Harris./NN While/IN both/DT of/IN her/PRP$ daughters/NN silently/NN contemplate/VB the/DT significance/NN of/IN their/PRP$ mother's/JJ strong/JJ urge/NN to/TO recall/VB and/CC redress/VB her/PRP$ ill-fated/NN affair/NN with/IN this/DT

Will/MD we/PRP all/RB realize/VB that/WH settling/VB for/IN the/DT imperfect/NN is/VB the/DT only/JJ realistic/JJ outcome?/IN The/DT subtle/JJ fact/NN that/IN the/DT aged/VB Ann/NN is/VB still/RB

Evening/NN is/VB interesting/JJ -/. most/RB of/IN the/DT film/NN is/VB spent/VB in/RP Ann's/NN mind/NN as/IN she/PRP recalls/VB the/DT past,/NN and/CC for/IN that/DT reason/NN I/PRP think/VB the/DT film/NN was/VB shot/VB as/RB if/IN it/PRP was/VB all/DT deliberately/RB overexposed,/VB to/TO give/VB everyone/NN an/DT ethereal/NN glow/NN (and/VB thus/RB make/VB it/PRP very/RB obvious/JJ that/IN

/><br/IN />You/DT can't/NN really/RB talk/VB trash/NN about/IN the/DT cast,/NN which/WH leads/VB off/RP with/RP Claire/NN Danes/NN and/CC doesn't/NN let/VB up/RP from/IN there:/TO Vanessa/NN Redgrave,/NN Patrick/NN Wilson,/NN Meryl/NN Streep/NN and/CC Glenn/NN Close/NN fill/VB out/RP the/DT other/JJ major/JJ and/CC minor/JJ roles/NN in/IN the/DT film.<br/NN /><br/IN />I/DT can't/NN really/RB say/VB anything/NN negative/JJ about/IN this/DT film/NN at/IN all,/NN though/IN Hugh/NN Dancy's/NN struggle/NN to/TO have/VB his/PRP$ character/NN emerge/VB from/IN utter/JJ
