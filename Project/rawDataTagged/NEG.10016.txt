Considering/VB John/NN Doe/NN apparently/RB inspired/VB Kyle/NN XY's/NN creator/NN I/PRP was/VB expecting/VB its/PRP$ pilot/NN to/TO be/VB quite/RB interesting./VB However/RB I/PRP probably/RB had/VB too/RB high/JJ expectations/NN because/IN I/PRP was/VB quite/RB disappointed/VB by/IN it./DT First/NN they/PRP turned/VB the/DT protagonist/NN into/IN a/DT freak/NN who/WH had/VB the/DT crazy/JJ idea/NN of/IN showing/VB off/RP his/PRP$ amazing/JJ knowledge/NN in/IN front/NN of/IN an/DT audience,/NN in/IN a/DT public/JJ area./NN So/RB after/IN that/DT scene/NN I/PRP began/VB to/TO worry/VB that/IN it/PRP was/VB just/RB entertainment./.
