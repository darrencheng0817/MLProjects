the/DT movie/NN opens/VB with/IN a/DT beautiful/JJ lady/NN in/IN a/DT tattered/JJ white/JJ gown/NN running/VB through/IN a/DT stereotypical/JJ eastern/JJ european/NN town./. we/PRP know/VB she's/TO being/VB followed/VB by/IN something,/NN because/IN she/PRP keeps/VB looking/VB behind/IN her./NN and/CC soon/RB we/PRP see/VB she's/TO being/VB chased/VB by/IN a/DT mysterious/NN man/NN in/IN a/DT black/JJ trenchcoat./NN then/RB we/PRP realize/VB that/IN the/DT man/NN is/VB actually/RB the/DT vampire/NN hunter/. and/CC he/PRP is/VB after/IN her./NN but/CC look/VB is/VB that/IN her/PRP$ reflection/NN in/IN the/DT store/NN window???/IN no/DT its/PRP$ just/RB her/PRP$ identical/JJ twin/JJ vampire!/NN but/CC unfortunately/RB they/PRP both/DT get/VB it.<br/DT /><br/NN />after/IN this/DT brilliant/JJ and/CC amazingly/NN fun/NN throwback/VB to/TO the/DT old/JJ hammer/NN films/NN of/IN the/DT 60's/NN and/CC 70's/NN (in/IN the/DT credits/NN the/DT twins/NN are/VB listed/VB as/IN the/DT twins/NN of/IN evil,/NN which/WH of/IN course/NN is/VB the/DT name/NN of/IN the/DT final/JJ instalment/NN in/IN hammer's/DT karnstein/NN trilogy),/IN the/DT plot/NN pretty/RB much/JJ dies.<br/NN /><br/IN />What/DT little/JJ plot/NN there/EX is/VB involves/VB dracula/IN (who/DT conveniently/NN changes/VB his/PRP$ appearance/NN each/DT time/NN he/PRP is/VB reborn,/VB so/RB the/DT producer/NN doesn't/NN have/VB to/TO rehire/VB the/DT same/JJ dracula)/NN coming/VB to/TO a/DT morgue,/NN the/DT med/NN students/NN realizing/VB he's/DT undead/NN and/CC thinking....wow/NN what/WH an/DT opportunity,/NN maybe/RB i'll/VB just/RB disregard/VB all/PDT those/DT movies/NN that/WH say/VB that/IN drinking/NN vampire/NN blood/NN turns/VB you/PRP into/IN a/DT vampire/NN and/CC use/VB the/DT vampire's/NN blood/NN to/TO find/VB a/DT cure/NN for/IN our/PRP$ jerk/NN friend's/NN ailment./VB obviously/RB this/DT is/VB a/DT mistake/NN and/CC everyone/NN becomes/VB a/DT vampire.<br/NN /><br/IN />A/DT new/JJ concept/NN but/CC pulled/VB off/RP excruciatingly/NN badly./IN The/DT movie/NN keeps/VB setting/VB up/RP wonderful/JJ situations/NN and/CC refuses/VB to/TO do/VB anything/NN with/IN them.<br/DT /><br/NN />For/NN example/NN the/DT med/NN students/NN attempt/NN to/TO bring/VB drac/VB back/RP to/TO life/NN by/IN placing/VB him/PRP in/IN a/DT bathtub/NN filled/VB with/IN blood/NN in/IN a/DT secluded/NN run/VB down/RP country/NN mansion./IN The/DT house/NN itself/PRP is/VB scary/JJ enough/JJ to/TO be/VB the/DT center/NN of/IN the/DT film,/NN but/CC do/VB we/PRP stay/VB there?/VB no/RB because/IN they/PRP decide/VB to/TO take/VB the/DT vampire/NN to/TO an/DT abandoned/JJ swimming/NN pool./NN sigh./IN This/DT movie/NN has/VB a/DT real/JJ problem/NN with/IN "homages"/NN as/IN i/FW mentioned/VB before/IN the/DT opening/NN scene/NN is/VB straight/RB out/RB of/IN hammer,/NN and/CC this/DT house/NN scene/NN would/MD have/VB been/VB perfect/JJ for/IN a/DT hammer-like/NN movie,/. but/CC the/DT movie/NN rapidly/RB switches/VB gears/NN and/CC changes/NN to/TO a/DT medical/JJ horror.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT other/JJ problem/NN is/VB that/IN they/PRP introduce/VB so/RB many/JJ characters/NN it/PRP is/VB almost/RB impossible/JJ to/TO feel/VB sorry/JJ for/IN any/DT of/IN them./NN There/EX are/VB the/DT med/NN students/NN and/CC their/PRP$ wheelchair/NN bound/VB professor-type/NN "friend"/IN the/DT med/NN students/NN are/VB all:/IN arrogant,/DT boring,/NN money/NN hungry,/. and/CC stupid./NN how/WH they/PRP made/VB it/PRP to/TO med/VB school/NN at/IN all/DT amazes/NN me,/NN unless/IN the/DT med/NN school/NN had/VB to/TO meet/VB its/PRP$ muscle/NN bound/VB hunk/big/IN breast/DT quota./NN and/CC then/RB there/EX is/VB the/DT vampire/NN hunter/. who/WH remains/VB mysterious/NN through/IN the/DT movie./NN hey/. i/FW can/MD respect/VB that/IN but/CC it/PRP would/MD be/VB nice/JJ if/IN they/PRP didn't/MD set/VB it/PRP up/RP like/IN the/DT movie/NN would/MD be/VB about/RB him./VB then/RB you/PRP have/VB random/JJ priests,/NN cops,/. and/CC science/NN types./VB so/RB many/JJ people/NN are/VB introduced/VB and/CC then/RB quickly/RB forgotten/VB about/RB until/IN they/PRP need/VB that/IN person/NN to/TO either/RB save/VB the/DT day/NN or/CC jump/VB out/RP for/IN a/DT cheap/JJ scare/NN that/IN it/PRP becomes/VB quickly/RB tedious.<br/JJ /><br/NN />Basically/IN this/DT is/VB a/DT lazy/JJ movie./IN no/DT real/JJ scares,/NN just/RB a/DT few/JJ predictable/JJ jump/NN scares./IN The/DT set/VB up/RP for/IN these/DT is/VB so/RB elaborate/VB it/PRP is/VB hilarious./NN for/IN examp/DT le/FW the/DT bathtub/NN full/JJ of/IN blood./VB it/PRP is/VB so/RB obvious/JJ that/IN drac/NN is/VB going/VB to/TO pop/VB out/RP of/IN the/DT murky/JJ blood./NN and/CC yet/RB we/PRP have/VB to/TO wait/VB far/RB too/RB long/RB to/TO get/VB to/TO the/DT inevitable/JJ jump/NN scare./NN after/IN this/DT he/PRP kills/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT dumber/JJ and/CC larger/JJ breasted/NN med/NN students./. we/PRP all/RB know/VB she's/TO going/VB to/TO become/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT undead./NN but/CC what/WH do/VB the/DT others/NN do?/NN bury/. her/PRP in/IN a/DT shallow/NN grave/NN near/IN the/DT house./NN sigh,/VB so/RB you/PRP know/VB who/WH will/MD jump/VB out/RP at/IN you/PRP when/WH the/DT cops/NN show/VB up/RP at/IN the/DT house..........<br/NN /><br/IN />Oh/DT well.<br/NN /><br/IN />Maybe/DT someone/NN will/MD get/VB the/DT hint/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VB impossible/JJ to/TO make/VB a/DT scary/JJ vampire/NN movie/NN and/CC just/RB go/VB for/IN atmospheric,/NN and/CC then/RB we/PRP will/MD end/VB up/RP with/IN an/DT entire/JJ movie/NN that/WH is/VB as/IN good/JJ as/IN the/DT opening/NN scene.<br/IN /><br/DT />/NN
