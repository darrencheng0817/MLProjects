Walt/NN Disney/NN &/CC his/PRP$ 9/CD Old/NN Men/NN put/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ 1950/CD spin/NN on/IN the/DT classic/JJ fairy/NN tale/NN of/RP Cinderella,/NN which/WH I/PRP guess/VB you/PRP could/MD

her/PRP$ awkward,/JJ unattractive/JJ daughters/NN (to/NN call/VB them/PRP "homely"/RB would/MD be/VB an/DT insult/NN to/TO homely/VB people/NN everywhere)/NN while/IN all/DT three/CD relegated/TO Cinderella/NN to/TO being/VB the/DT multi-tasking/NN servant/NN of/IN the/DT house,/NN abusing/VB her,/TO mistreating/VB her/PRP and/CC humiliating/JJ her/PRP every/DT chance/NN they/PRP get/VB (they/TO are/VB particularly/RB fond/VB of/IN increasing/VB her/PRP already/RB absurd/JJ workload)./NN That/WH brings/VB us/PRP to/TO Cinderella/NN in/IN the/DT present,/NN where/WH she/PRP has/VB

glaring/NN of/IN which/WH is/VB that/IN the/DT Prince/NN is/VB little/RB more/RB than/IN a/FW MacGuffin/NN to/TO help/VB push/VB the/DT plot/NN along/RB -/. he/PRP has/VB very/RB little/JJ screen/NN
