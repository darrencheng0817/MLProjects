Horror/NN omnibus/NN films/NN were/VB popular/JJ in/IN the/DT seventies./RP I'm/NN not/RB very/RB fond/VB of/IN them/PRP myself,/VB but/CC this/DT one/NN is/VB an/DT undeniably/RB excellent/JJ slice/NN of/IN British/JJ horror/NN cinema./IN The/DT House/NN That/WH Dripped/NN Blood/NN is/VB a/DT horror/NN omnibus,/NN featuring/VB four/CD stories/NN that/WH surround/VB a/DT creepy/JJ old/JJ house/NN in/IN the/DT country/NN and/CC are/VB being/VB told/VB to/TO a/DT Scotland/NN Yard/NN officer/NN by/IN an/DT estate/NN agent.<br/IN /><br/DT />This/NN film/NN is/VB headlined/NN by/IN three/CD well/RB known/VB stars/VB of/IN horror/NN cinema;/NN Peter/NN Cushing,/NN Christopher/NN Lee/NN and/CC Ingrid/NN Pitt,/NN whom/WH horror/NN fans/NN will/MD recognise/VB as/IN one/PRP of/RP Lee's/NN co-stars/NN in/IN the/DT greatest/JJ British/JJ horror/NN film/NN of/IN all/DT time;/NN The/DT Wicker/NN Man.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT first/JJ segment/NN of/IN the/DT film,/NN titled/VB "Method/NN For/IN Murder"/NN tells/VB the/DT story/NN of/IN a/DT horror/NN storywriter,/. whose/WH$ creation;/NN a/DT strangler/NN named/VB "Dominic"/TO is/VB brought/VB to/TO life/NN by/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ imagination./IN This/DT story/NN builds/VB suspense/NN very/RB well;/VB through/IN his/PRP$ girlfriend,/NN he,/. and/CC the/DT audience/NN is/VB lead/VB to/TO believe/VB that/IN what/WH he/PRP is/VB seeing/VB is/VB a/DT figment/NN of/IN his/PRP$ imagination./NN This/DT story/NN certainly/RB isn't/VB very/RB original,/. but/CC it/PRP makes/VB up/RP for/IN its/PRP$ lack/NN of/IN originality/NN through/IN the/DT atmosphere/NN it/PRP creates/VB and/CC it's/DT final/JJ twist;/NN which/WH works/VB incredibly/RB well/RB and/CC came/VB as/IN a/DT genuine/JJ surprise.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT second/JJ story,/NN titled/VB "Waxworks",/DT stars/NN Peter/NN Cushing/NN and/CC is/VB my/PRP$ least/JJ favourite/NN of/IN the/DT four./NN This/DT tale/NN follows/VB the/DT story/NN of/IN Phillip/NN Grayson/NN (Cushing),/IN a/DT man/NN that/WH discovers/VB a/DT wax/NN museum/NN and/CC decides/VB to/TO venture/VB in./RP Inside,/NN he/PRP discovers/VB a/DT woman/NN that/WH is/VB familiar/JJ to/TO him/PRP and/CC who/WH we/PRP later/RB find/VB out/RP is/VB a/DT murderess./JJ Quite/JJ what/WH the/DT woman's/NN relationship/NN with/IN Phillip/NN entailed/NN is/VB never/RB really/RB explained,/. but/CC the/DT tale/NN relies/VB more/RB on/IN the/DT mystery/NN to/TO build/VB the/DT suspense/NN rather/RB than/IN plot/VB details./RP Cushing/NN is/VB later/RB joined/VB by/IN his/PRP$ friend,/FW Neville/NN Rogers/NN (played/VB by/RP Joss/NN Ackland)/NN and/CC that's/NN when/WH the/DT tale/NN really/RB starts/VB to/TO pick/VB up./IN The/DT setting/NN of/IN a/DT waxwork/NN museum/NN full/JJ of/IN murderers/NN for/IN a/DT horror/NN film/NN isn't/IN a/DT new/JJ idea;/IN the/DT same/JJ setting/NN was/VB used/VB to/TO great/JJ effect/NN in/IN the/DT excellent/JJ 1966/CD horror/NN film,/NN "Chamber/VB of/RP Horrors"./NN Although/IN the/DT one/NN here/RB isn't/VB as/IN grand/JJ as/IN the/DT one/CD in/IN the/DT aforementioned/JJ film,/IN the/DT power/NN of/IN the/DT setting/NN is/VB used/VB to/TO no/DT lesser/JJ a/DT horrifying/JJ effect,/NN much/RB of/IN which/WH is/VB achieved/VB by/IN a/DT feeling/NN of/IN claustrophobia,/NN brought/VB about/RB by/IN the/DT limited/JJ area/NN of/IN the/DT museum./NN Peter/NN Cushing/NN is/VB always/RB interesting/JJ to/TO watch,/NN and/CC seeing/VB him/PRP avoid/VB an/DT axe-wielding/NN madman/NN is/VB a/DT treat/VB for/IN the/DT horror/NN fan./NN Despite/IN being/VB my/PRP$ least/JJ favourite,/IN this/DT story/NN is/VB still/RB entertaining/JJ and/CC interesting/JJ enough/JJ to/TO not/RB let/VB this/DT anthology/NN down.<br/IN /><br/DT />The/NN film/NN continues/VB with/IN "Sweets/NN for/IN the/DT Sweet",/NN which/WH is/VB without/IN doubt/VB the/DT best/JJ of/IN the/DT omnibus./NN This/DT story/NN stars/VB the/DT legendary/JJ Christopher/NN Lee/NN as/IN a/DT seemingly/RB overprotective/VB father./IN The/DT beauty/NN of/IN this/DT story/NN comes/VB from/IN the/DT way/NN it/PRP is/VB played/VB out./IN It/PRP leaves/VB the/DT audience/NN guessing;/. we/PRP know/VB that/IN there/EX is/VB something/NN wrong/JJ with/IN either/RB the/DT father/NN or/CC the/DT daughter,/NN but/CC we/PRP don't/MD know/VB who,/NN or/CC what,/VB it/PRP is./VB Christopher/NN Lee,/NN as/IN usual,/NN portrays/VB his/PRP$ character/NN with/IN a/DT great/JJ degree/NN of/IN sinisterness;/IN the/DT audience/NN is/VB left/VB to/TO simmer/VB over/RP his/PRP$ actions/NN regarding/VB giving/VB his/PRP$ daughter/NN a/DT doll,/NN and/CC the/DT fact/NN that/IN she/PRP isn't/MD allowed/VB to/TO go/VB to/TO school/NN or/CC have/VB any/DT toys./NN The/DT card/NN of/IN exactly/RB why/WH is/VB held/VB close/VB to/TO the/DT chest/NN until/IN right/NN near/IN the/DT end,/NN epitomised/NN by/IN the/DT truly/RB chilling/JJ line/NN in/IN which/WH Lee/NN tells/VB his/PRP$ babysitter/NN that/IN he/PRP is,/VB in/IN fact,/DT afraid/JJ of/IN his/PRP$ daughter./NN The/DT ending/VB to/TO this/DT section/NN is/VB superbly/TO played/VB out,/NN in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN it's/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT finest/JJ endings/NN to/TO any/DT horror/NN story/NN ever/RB told,/. and/CC will/MD stay/VB with/IN you/PRP long/RB after/IN the/DT end/NN credits/NN roll.<br/IN /><br/DT />The/NN omnibus/NN finishes/VB with/RP "The/RP Cloak",/NN which/WH is/VB definitely/RB the/DT most/JJ comedic/JJ of/IN the/DT four./NN This/DT tale/NN is/VB about/IN a/DT hammy/NN horror/NN film/NN star/NN that,/NN unimpressed/NN by/IN his/PRP$ latest/JJ film's/NN technical/JJ side,/NN goes/VB out/RP and/CC buys/VB himself/PRP a/DT cloak./RP Naturally,/NN this/DT cloak/VB turns/VB out/RP to/TO be/VB a/DT real/JJ vampire/NN cloak./NN Unlike/IN the/DT other/JJ three/CD tales,/IN this/DT one/NN seems/VB to/TO be/VB played/VB out/RP mostly/RB for/IN laughs./NN That/WH is/VB no/DT bad/JJ thing/NN however/RB as/IN the/DT majority/NN of/IN the/DT humour/NN is/VB funny/JJ and/CC it/PRP serves/VB as/IN a/DT nice/JJ contrast/NN to/TO the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT film./NN The/DT ending/VB to/TO this/DT tale/NN coincides/VB nicely/RB with/IN the/DT ending/VB to/TO the/DT wraparound/NN story/NN of/IN the/DT film,/NN which/WH is/VB a/DT very/RB sinister/JJ yet/RB humorous/VB ending/VB to/TO a/DT very/RB good/JJ film./RP Also,/NN look/VB out/RP for/IN the/DT little/JJ jibe/NN regarding/VB Christopher/NN Lee/NN in/RP Dracula./NN A/DT nice/JJ touch,/. I/PRP think.<br/VB /><br/DT />Overall,/NN if/IN you/PRP want/VB a/DT horror/NN omnibus,/. you/PRP really/RB cant/VB go/VB wrong/JJ with/IN The/DT House/NN that/WH Dripped/NN Blood./NN The/DT third/JJ tale/NN alone/RB makes/VB the/DT film/NN worthy/JJ of/IN your/PRP$ time/NN and/CC this/DT is/VB a/DT very/RB solid/JJ horror/NN film/NN indeed./NN
