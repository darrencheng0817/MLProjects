I/PRP felt/VB it/PRP necessary/JJ to/TO respond/VB to/TO the/DT comments/NN posted/VB on/IN the/DT front/JJ page/NN of/IN this/DT film's/NN page/NN because/IN some/DT of/IN it/PRP was/VB slightly/RB misinformative.<br/JJ /><br/NN />Originally/. I/PRP posted/VB quotes/VB from/IN the/DT original/JJ poster,/NN but/CC I/PRP wasn't/VB sure/JJ if/IN it/PRP was/VB proper/JJ given/VB that/IN this/DT is/VB the/DT "comments"/NN index/NN and/CC not/RB a/DT message/NN board/NN (though/. we/PRP used/VB to/TO use/VB 'em/PRP that/IN way/NN back/VB before/RP IMDb/NN added/VB the/DT film/NN message/NN boards)/VB so/RB I/PRP will/MD edit/VB this/DT to/TO make/VB it/PRP unnecessary.<br/VB /><br/IN />Well,/DT first/JJ of/IN all/DT you/PRP may/MD not/RB be/VB aware/JJ of/IN this,/NN but/CC Gene/NN Kelly/NN first/RB became/VB famous/JJ for/IN playing/VB "Pal/RP Joey"/NN on/IN Broadway/NN in/IN the/DT original/JJ production./NN When/WH Vincente/NN Minnelli/NN decided/VB to/TO make/VB a/FW Gershwin/NN "panorama"/NN film,/. he/PRP wanted/VB Kelly's/NN character/NN to/TO be/VB more/RB sophisticated/JJ than/IN the/DT "goody/$ two/CD shoes"/NN roles/NN he/PRP had/VB been/VB playing/VB in/IN most/RB his/PRP$ films/NN (with/IN the/DT exception/NN of/IN "For/VB Me/PRP and/CC My/PRP$ Gal")./NN Alan/NN Jay/NN Lerner/NN was/VB instructed/VB to/TO construct/VB a/DT new/JJ story/NN set/VB in/IN Paris/NN based/VB on/IN the/DT story/NN of/RB "Pal/RP Joey"./NN This/DT gave/VB Kelly/NN a/DT chance/NN to/TO play/VB his/PRP$ famous/JJ role/NN from/IN Broadway/NN even/RB though/IN Warners/NN had/VB outbid/VB MGM/NN for/IN the/DT rights/NN to/TO "Pal/PRP$ Joey."/NN In/IN my/PRP$ opinion,/NN the/DT WB/NN film/NN "Pal/RP Joey"/NN is/VB a/DT wreck,/NN though/RB Sinatra/NN was/VB suitable/JJ for/IN the/DT role,/NN but/CC other/JJ problems/NN sunk/VB the/DT film/NN (script/NN changes/NN and/CC poor/JJ direction./NN ===================================================<br/IN /><br/DT />You/NN complain/VB that/WH Kelly's/NN pictures/NN are/VB not/RB well/RB done,/VB even/RB citing/VB your/PRP$ art/NN education/NN to/TO prove/VB the/DT point./NN But/CC you/PRP miss/VB the/DT fact/NN that/WH Kelly's/NN bad/JJ art/NN was/VB clearly/RB designed/VB to/TO be/VB bad,/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VB necessary/JJ for/IN the/DT story/characters./NN The/DT pictures/NN are/VB so/RB bad,/VB the/DT audience/NN knows/VB that/IN Kelly/NN isn't/IN ready/JJ for/IN an/DT exhibition./NN Even/RB he/PRP knows/VB it,/VB though/RB Milo/NN has/VB sort/NN of/IN sugared/VB him/PRP up/RP to/TO the/DT point/NN where/WH he/PRP almost/RB believes/VB her./NN But/CC it's/DT important/JJ that/IN the/DT audience/NN not/RB be/VB sitting/VB there/EX saying/VB "but,/NN he's/IN a/DT great/JJ artist,/NN if/IN he/PRP only/RB had/VB the/DT chance!"./NN You/PRP want/VB the/DT audience/NN to/TO be/VB fully/RB aware/JJ of/IN his/PRP$ deficiencies.<br/NN /><br/NN />Then/. you/PRP complain/VB that/IN he/PRP sabotages/VB his/PRP$ interest/NN in/IN the/DT show;/NN again/RB you/PRP are/VB not/RB understanding/VB the/DT structure/NN of/IN the/DT story./NN He/PRP refuses/VB because/IN he/PRP doesn't/MD want/VB to/TO feel/VB like/IN a/DT gigolo,/NN and/CC because/IN he/PRP knows/VB he's/VB not/RB really/RB ready/JJ for/IN the/DT exhibition./VB His/PRP$ enthusiasm/NN for/IN the/DT exhibition/NN is/VB certainly/RB not/RB as/IN great/JJ as/IN "Joey's"/DT enthusiasm/NN to/TO "start/VB a/DT nightclub"./NN But/CC it/PRP serves/VB the/DT same/JJ function/NN in/IN the/DT plot./RP Remember,/NN it's/IN essential/JJ in/RP "Pal/RP Joey"/NN (the/NN play)/. that/WH Joey/NN gives/VB up/RP his/PRP$ nightclub/NN after/IN he/PRP realizes/VB that/IN he/PRP doesn't/MD deserve/VB it./DT Same/JJ with/IN the/DT art/NN show./NN If/IN Kelly's/NN paintings/NN were/VB actually/RB good,/VB it/PRP would/MD undermine/VB this/DT whole/JJ point./NN ===================================================<br/NN /><br/NN />Then/. you/PRP complain/VB that/WH Caron/NN and/CC Kelly/NN have/VB no/RB "chemistry"./VB I/PRP guess/VB it's/NN in/IN the/DT eye/NN of/IN the/DT beholder./NN I/PRP agree,/VB the/DT chemistry/NN between/IN them/PRP is/VB not/RB as/IN strong/JJ as/IN it/PRP should/MD be,/VB but/CC for/IN me/PRP it/PRP was/VB fine./RP Compare/NN it/PRP to/TO even/RB worse/JJ "forced"/NN romances/NN like/IN the/DT one/CD between/IN Cary/NN Grant/NN and/CC Sophia/NN Loren/NN in/RP "The/RP Pride/NN and/CC the/DT Passion"./NN ====================================================<br/NN /><br/NN />When/. you/PRP say/VB that/IN the/DT big/JJ dance/NN finale/NN has/VB nothing/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN anything/NN else/RB in/IN this/DT film,/NN it/PRP just/RB shows/VB that/IN you/PRP haven't/MD dug/VB beneath/IN the/DT surface/NN of/IN the/DT film/NN into/IN its/PRP$ symbolism./JJ Many/JJ elements/NN in/IN the/DT dance/NN sequence/NN relate/VB to/TO the/DT story/NN and/CC characters,/NN and/CC through/IN the/DT dance/NN the/DT plot/NN is/VB resolved/VB through/IN images/NN and/CC symbolism./RP It's/NN about/IN finding/VB love,/TO enjoying/VB love,/VB then/RB losing/VB love/VB (he/TO looks/VB around/RP and/CC his/PRP$ love/NN is/VB gone)./IN The/DT movements/NN of/IN the/DT symphony/NN are/VB constructed/VB so/RB that/IN part/NN of/IN each/DT dance/NN scene/NN mirrors/IN a/DT separate/JJ phase/NN of/RP Parisian/NN Art/NN and/CC also/RB a/DT separate/JJ phase/NN of/IN their/PRP$ relationships./NN If/IN you/PRP didn't'/MD see/VB that,/TO it's/VB not/RB the/DT movie's/VB fault./RP It's/NN certainly/RB not/RB a/DT "load/NN of/IN
