Okay,/NN I'll/NN admit/VB the/DT casting/NN in/IN the/DT film/NN is/VB REALLY/NN strange--part/NN of/IN this/DT is/VB due/JJ to/TO the/DT plot,/NN but/CC I/PRP still/RB had/VB a/DT bit/NN of/IN trouble/NN believing/VB Pierce/NN Brosnan/NN playing/VB this/DT lead/NN (though/. he/PRP really/RB did/VB a/DT pretty/RB good/JJ job).<br/NN /><br/NN />It's/NN based/VB on/IN a/DT true/JJ story/NN of/IN an/DT Englishman/NN who/WH went/VB to/TO live/VB with/IN the/DT Canadian/JJ Indians/NN in/IN the/DT early/JJ 20th/JJ century./.
