OK,but/NN does/VB that/WH make/VB this/DT a/DT good/JJ movie?well,not/NN really,in/IN my/PRP$ opinion.there/NN isn't/IN a/DT whole/JJ lot/NN to/TO recommend/VB it.i/TO found/VB it/PRP very/RB slow,tediously,in/VB fact.it's/VB also/RB predictable/JJ pretty/RB much/RB through/IN and/CC through.number/$ one/CD and/CC two/CD were/VB somewhat/RB predictable,but/VB not/RB as/RB much.i/VB also/RB felt/VB this/DT movie/NN was/VB quite/RB campy/VB at/IN times,which/DT i/FW didn't/. really/RB think/VB fits/VB this/DT series/NN and/CC the/DT character.Jeff/RP Fahey/NN plays/VB the/DT main/JJ bad/JJ guy/NN in/IN this/DT installment.he's/NN a/DT decent/JJ enough/JJ actor,but/NN i/FW felt/VB he/PRP played/VB his/PRP$ character/NN too/RB over/IN the/DT top.i/NN guess/VB that/WH fit/VB with/IN the/DT tone/NN of/IN the/DT movie,which/NN would/MD have/VB been/VB great/JJ if/IN i/FW had/VB liked/VB the/DT movie.plus,there/NN were/VB some/DT pretty/RB bad/JJ one/NN liners.Arnold/RP Vosloo/NN returns/NN in/IN the/DT title/NN role,but/NN is/VB given/VB little/JJ to/TO work/VB with/IN in/IN this/DT movie.the/NN character/NN has/VB not/RB really/RB evolved,as/. i/FW had/VB hoped.oh/DT well.this/NN is/VB just/RB my/PRP$ opinion.anyway,for/NN me,while/IN this/DT movie/NN is/VB not/RB abysmal,it/VB is/VB pretty/RB bad.my/VB vote/VB for/RP Darkman/NN III:/NN 3.5/5/NN
