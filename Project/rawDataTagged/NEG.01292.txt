"Nacho/TO Libre"/NN (2006)/NN <br/NN /><br/VB />Directed/RP By:/NN Jared/NN Hess/NN <br/IN /><br/DT />Starring:/NN Jack/NN Black,/NN Ana/NN de/FW la/FW Reguera,/NN Héctor/NN Jiménez,/NN &/CC Darius/NN Rose/NN <br/NN /><br/VB />MPAA/RP Rating:/NN "PG-13"/NN (for/IN some/DT rough/JJ action,/NN and/CC crude/JJ humor/NN including/VB dialog)/IN <br/DT /><br/NN />Say/. what/WH you/PRP will/MD about/RB it/PRP (I/MD know/VB some/DT people/NN who/WH despise/VB it/PRP to/TO no/DT end),/NN but/CC I/PRP have/VB always/RB thought/VB that/DT "Napoleon/RP Dynamite"/NN was/VB a/DT funny/JJ movie--not/IN the/DT brightest/JJ brick/NN on/IN the/DT wall,/NN but/CC a/DT funny/JJ movie,/NN nonetheless./NN Jack/NN Black/NN is/VB also/RB a/DT very/RB funny/JJ man--irritating/NN at/IN times,/DT yes,/NN and/CC massively/NN overrated/NN by/IN adolescent/JJ audiences/NN who/WH practically/RB worship/NN him,/. but/CC funny./VB There/EX has/VB rarely/RB been/VB a/DT Jack/NN Black/NN comedy/NN that/IN I/PRP did/VB not/RB enjoy/VB to/TO some/DT degree./RP So,/NN I/PRP was/VB very/RB happy/JJ to/TO hear/VB that/WH Jared/NN Hess,/NN the/DT writer/NN and/CC director/NN of/RB "Napoleon/RP Dynamite",/NN and/CC Jack/NN Black/NN would/MD be/VB teaming/VB up/RP for/IN a/DT movie/NN about/IN a/DT Spanish/JJ friar/NN who/WH becomes/VB a/DT wrestler/NN to/TO save/VB an/DT orphanage./VB My/PRP$ only/JJ reservation/NN was/VB that/IN the/DT plot/NN seemed/VB a/DT little/JJ too/RB thin./RP Unfortunately,/NN my/PRP$ one/CD reservation/NN turned/VB out/RP to/TO be/VB downfall/NN of/IN the/DT entire/JJ movie./IN This/DT plot,/NN had/VB it/PRP been/VB done/VB as/IN a/DT skit/NN on/IN some/DT such/JJ show/NN as/IN "Saturday/DT Night/NN Live"/NN or/CC possibly/RB even/RB "Mad/RP TV",/NN would/MD have/VB worked/VB flawlessly./RP Unfortunately,/NN the/DT plot/NN runs/VB far/RB too/RB thin/JJ over/IN the/DT approximate/$ one/CD and/CC a/DT half/NN hour/NN runtime/. and/CC this/DT one-joke/NN comedy/NN falls/VB flat.<br/IN /><br/DT />Nacho/NN was/VB raised/VB in/IN a/DT Mexican/JJ monastery/NN and/CC became/VB a/DT devout/JJ man/NN of/IN the/DT Lord./NN Feeling/NN shunned/VB by/IN the/DT entire/JJ monastery,/RP Nacho/NN (Black),/VB now/RB the/DT monastery's/NN cook,/NN decides/VB to/TO follow/VB his/PRP$ dreams/NN to/TO become/VB a/DT professional/JJ wrestler./NN As/IN the/DT monastery's/NN finances/NN hit/VB an/DT all-time/JJ low,/RP Nacho/NN decides/VB to/TO join/VB a/DT wresting/NN tournament/VB so/RB that/IN he/PRP can/MD win/VB the/DT prize/NN money/NN and/CC provide/VB good/JJ food/NN for/IN the/DT monastery's/NN orphanage./IN This/DT plot/NN sounds/VB so/RB sweet/JJ and/CC caring./VB It/PRP seems/VB like/IN the/DT perfect/JJ movie/NN for/IN Jack/NN Black./NN Look/VB what/WH he/PRP did/VB with/IN "School/VB of/RP Rock"/NN after/RB all./RP Well,/NN to/TO my/PRP$ displeasure,/NN this/DT plot/NN is/VB almost/RB completely/RB ruined/VB by/IN offensive/JJ and/CC gross/JJ humor/NN that/IN just/RB takes/VB away/RP from/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN the/DT movie./NN It/PRP is/VB again/RB Hollywood's/NN way/NN of/IN showing/NN that/IN they/PRP feel/VB that/IN teen/NN audiences/NN will/MD only/RB understand/VB fart/DT jokes/NN and/CC stupid/JJ humorof/NN course,/NN for/IN all/DT I/PRP know,/VB maybe/RB that/WH is/VB the/DT general/JJ thought/NN of/IN teenagers,/NN as/IN many/JJ seemed/VB to/TO enjoy/VB this/DT movie./RP Watching/NN an/DT obese/NN woman/NN scurry/VB like/IN a/DT mouse/NN across/IN the/DT floor/NN will/MD certainly/RB make/VB people/NN laugh,/. but/CC don't/NN expect/VB to/TO get/VB an/DT award/NN for/IN putting/VB it/PRP in/IN your/PRP$ movie./NN A/DT seven-year-old/JJ could/MD make/VB up/RP the/DT same/JJ joke.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT performances/NN in/RP "Nacho/RP Libre"/NN are/VB actually/RB good./JJ Jack/NN Black/NN proves/VB once/RB again/RB that/IN he/PRP is/VB absolutely/RB hilarious/. and/CC that/WH he/PRP can/MD make/VB even/RB the/DT most/JJ idiotic,/NN worthless/JJ lines/NN in/IN ever/RB put/VB on/IN paper/NN comical./RP Unfortunately,/NN this/DT movie/NN just/RB wasn't/VB enough/RB for/IN him./VB It/PRP didn't/MD give/VB him/PRP anything/NN to/TO go/VB on/IN and/CC the/DT only/JJ reason/NN any/RB of/IN his/PRP$ jokes/NN worked/VB was/VB because/IN of/IN him./VB I/PRP had/VB never/RB seen/VB or/CC heard/VB of/IN Ana/NN de/FW la/FW Reguera/NN before,/. but/CC now/RB I/PRP can/MD say/VB that,/VB not/RB only/RB is/VB she/PRP quite/RB talented,/. but/CC she/PRP is/VB also/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT most/JJ beautiful/JJ women/NN to/TO have/VB ever/RB graced/VB my/PRP$ eyesight./NN She/PRP just/RB clicked/VB in/IN the/DT role/NN and/CC it/PRP worked/VB wonderfully/RB well./RP Héctor/NN Jiménez,/NN who/WH plays/VB Nacho's/NN bumbling/VB partner,/RP Esqueleto,/NN kept/VB me/PRP laughing/VB continuously./IN He/PRP did/VB a/DT very/RB nice/JJ job/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VB very/RB effective/JJ when/WH partnered/VB with/IN that/DT of/IN Jack/NN Black's./NN Darius/NN Rose,/NN who/WH plays/VB an/DT orphan/JJ named/VB Chancho,/NN didn't/NN have/VB many/JJ lines,/NN but,/. what/WH can/MD I/PRP say,/VB I/PRP just/RB enjoyed/VB him./IN He/PRP was/VB adorable./IN The/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT cast/NN did/VB their/PRP$ job./NN It/PRP is/VB unfortunate/JJ that/IN they/PRP were/VB wasted/NN on/IN such/PDT a/DT sub-par/NN movie.<br/NN /><br/VB />"Nacho/RP Libre"/NN just/RB does/VB not/RB work./VB Its/PRP$ plot/NN is/VB stretched/VB far/RB too/RB thin./VB The/DT heart/NN of/IN it/PRP all/RB is/VB soiled/NN by/IN moronic/DT humor/NN and/CC sickening/NN jokes/NN that/IN just/RB don't/VB work./IN I/PRP very/RB rarely/RB laughed/VB and,/NN if/IN I/PRP did,/VB it/PRP was/VB because/IN of/IN Jack/NN Black/NN or/CC another/DT member/NN of/IN the/DT cast./NN And/CC that/WH leads/VB me/PRP to/TO the/DT bright/JJ side/NN of/RB "Nacho/RP Libre":/NN yes,/IN the/DT cast./NN This/DT cast/NN was/VB justwell,/NN for/IN lack/NN of/IN a/DT better/JJ word,/. they/PRP were/VB on./IN They/PRP all/DT clicked,/NN had/VB excellent/JJ chemistry/NN together,/. and/CC pumped/VB as/IN much/JJ life/NN as/IN possible/JJ into/IN the/DT flat/JJ script./NN After/RB Jared/NN Hess's/NN "Napoleon/RP Dynamite"/NN kept/VB me/PRP thoroughly/MD entertained/VB for/IN the/DT entirety/NN of/IN the/DT movie,/NN I/PRP was/VB surprised/VB to/TO find/VB myself/PRP so/RB often/RB bored/JJ with/RP "Nacho/RP Libre"./NN Something/NN was/VB lost/VB here/RB and/CC I/PRP have/VB yet/RB to/TO understand/VB what/WH it/PRP was./VB All/DT I/PRP know/VB is/VB that/DT "Nacho/RP Libre"/NN is/VB not/RB a/DT good/JJ movie/NN and/CC yet,/NN because/IN of/IN its/PRP$ cast,/NN it/PRP is/VB completely/RB worthless./. There/EX is/VB a/DT small/JJ reason/NN to/TO watch,/VB if/IN only/RB to/TO watch/VB Jack/NN Black/NN work./RP But,/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VB not/RB a/DT fan/NN of/IN Jack/NN Black,/NN then/RB avoid/VB this/DT movie/NN like/IN the/DT plague./NN I/PRP like/VB Black,/NN but/CC I/PRP am/VB done/VB with/IN this/DT movie/NN and/CC with/IN this/DT review.<br/NN /><br/VB />Final/RP Thought:/NN Yikes!/NN This/DT is/VB Jared/NN Hess's/NN surprisingly/RB disappointing/JJ follow-up/NN to/TO his/PRP$ hysterical/NN "Napoleon/RP Dynamite".<br/NN /><br/VB />Overall/RP Rating:/NN 4/10/NN (C+)/NN
