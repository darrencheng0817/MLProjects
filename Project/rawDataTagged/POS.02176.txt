First/NN of/IN all,/NN let/VB me/PRP comment/VB that/IN the/DT audience/NN LOVED/NN it/PRP from/IN the/DT first/JJ moment./NN Perhaps/RB current/JJ events/NN in/IN the/DT Middle-East/NN led/VB people/NN to/TO take/VB the/DT attitude,/NN "I/NN came/VB for/IN a/DT comedy/NN and/CC by/IN George/NN I'm/NN going/VB to/TO enjoy/VB it."/NN but/CC for/IN whatever/WH reason,/VB everybody/NN seemed/VB really/RB into/IN the/DT comedy/NN of/IN it./IN The/DT last/JJ few/JJ times/NN Woody/NN has/VB tried/VB to/TO do/VB a/DT straight/JJ comedy/NN (Small/NN Time/NN Crooks,/NN Curse/NN of/IN the/DT Jade/NN Scorpion,/NN Hollywood/NN Ending)/NN I've/NN felt/VB like/IN the/DT one-liners/NN felt/VB strained/JJ and/CC a/DT bit/NN antiquated./. I/PRP remember/VB thinking/VB at/IN one/CD point,/NN "That/NN would/MD have/VB been/VB funny/JJ in/IN the/DT early/JJ sixties."/NN So/RB going/VB in/RP to/TO this/DT movie,/NN I/PRP was/VB afraid/JJ Woody/NN was/VB becoming/VB tone/NN deaf,/NN however,/NN in/IN this/DT one/NN his/PRP$ comic/JJ sensibilities/NN were/VB in/IN perfect/JJ tune./RP Admittedly,/NN there/EX were/VB plenty/RB of/IN my/PRP$ fellow/JJ AARP/NN card/NN carrying/VB folks/NN in/IN the/DT screening,/NN but/CC there/EX were/VB also/RB plenty/RB of/RP 20-somethings/CD and/CC 30-somethings/CD as/IN well,/NN and/CC they/PRP all/RB seemed/VB to/TO get/VB it/PRP and/CC give/VB up/RP the/DT occasional/JJ belly/NN laugh/NN in/IN addition/NN to/TO numerous/JJ guffaws,/NN chuckles/. and/CC the/DT like./NN In/IN many/JJ instances,/IN the/DT throw-aways/NN had/VB people/NN laughing/VB so/RB loud/JJ you/PRP missed/VB the/DT next/JJ line.<br/NN /><br/IN />Thematically,/DT Woody/NN was/VB traipsing/DT familiar/JJ ground./NN As/IN I/PRP suspected/VB from/IN the/DT trailer,/NN this/DT film/NN had/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN Manhattan/NN Murder/NN Mystery/NN in/IN it,/NN but/CC then/RB again,/. there/EX was/VB more/RB than/IN a/DT smidgen/VB of/RP Oedipus/NN Wrecks/NN (New/NN York/NN Stories),/NN Alice,/NN and/CC even/RB a/DT little/JJ tribute/NN to/TO Broadway/NN Danny/NN Rose/NN at/IN the/DT very/RB beginning.<br/VB /><br/DT />Even/NN with/IN Woody/NN in/IN the/DT movie,/RP Scarlett,/NN as/RB Sondra,/NN was,/NN at/IN times/NN the/DT Woody-proxy,/NN but/CC her/PRP$ character/NN was/VB far/RB from/IN the/DT Nebbish/NN that,/. say,/PRP Will/MD Ferrell/NN gave/VB us/PRP in/RP Melinda/NN and/CC Melinda/NN or/CC Kenneth/NN Branaugh/NN attempted/VB in/RP Celebrity./NN Instead/RB of/IN archetypal/DT ticks/NN and/CC quirks,/RP Sondra's/NN nerdishness/NN comes/VB directly/RB from/IN the/DT family/NN history/NN which/WH she/PRP shares/VB early/JJ on./NN On/IN numerous/JJ occasions/NN the/DT "family/NN business"/NN leads/VB her/PRP to/TO malapropisms/VB that/IN we/PRP get/VB as/IN an/DT audience,/NN while/IN the/DT characters/NN on/IN the/DT screen/NN can/MD only/RB perceive/VB them/PRP as/RB strange/JJ non-sequiturs./NN Since/IN we/PRP are/VB all/DT in/IN on/IN the/DT joke,/NN we/PRP can't/MD help/VB but/CC laugh./NN But/CC the/DT laughs/VB don't/TO come/VB from/IN recognizing/VB the/DT Woody/NN nebbish,/. but/CC truly/RB from/IN the/DT character./NN To/TO a/DT great/JJ extent,/NN unlike/IN Farrell,/NN Branaugh,/NN Cusack/NN or/CC even/RP Mia/NN Farrow/NN before/RB her,/RP Scarlett/NN is/VB not/RB required/VB to/TO use/VB the/DT Woody/NN voice/NN to/TO evoke/VB the/DT Woody/NN role./RP Thus,/NN we/PRP don't/MD find/VB ourselves/PRP ripped/VB out/RP of/IN the/DT narrative/NN as/IN a/FW Woody's/NN voice/NN suddenly/RB emerges/VB from/IN someone/NN else'/IN face.<br/DT /><br/NN />As/IN my/PRP$ friend/NN commented/VB on/IN the/DT way/NN out,/RP Sid,/NN the/DT character/NN played/VB by/RP Woody,/NN is/VB a/DT supporting/JJ role,/NN but/CC more/JJ center-stage/NN than/IN I/PRP was/VB hoping/VB going/VB in./RP However,/NN this/DT time/NN Woody/NN seems/VB to/TO have/VB written/VB a/DT character/NN that/IN truly/RB fits/VB his/PRP$ current/JJ persona./NN Unlike/IN his/PRP$ Ed/NN Dobel/NN sage/NN character/NN in/IN Anything/NN Else,/NN or/CC his/PRP$ blind/JJ director/NN in/IN Hollywood/NN Ending,/NN this/DT time/NN the/DT character/NN is/VB a/DT comfortable/JJ fit./NN Perhaps/RB more/RB importantly,/VB this/DT time/NN the/DT character/NN works/VB in/IN the/DT story./NN Within/IN the/DT elevated/JJ circles/NN they/PRP find/VB themselves/PRP in,/VB he/PRP is/VB even/RB more/RB fish-out-of-water/VB than/RB Scarlett,/NN which/WH is/VB used/VB to/TO great/JJ comedic/JJ effect/NN throughout./RP Sid/NN is/VB a/DT declining,/NN itinerant/NN magician/NN playing/VB to/TO small/JJ audiences,/NN but/CC the/DT fact/NN that/IN he/PRP is/VB from/IN another/DT era/NN is/VB placed/VB front/NN and/CC center/NN for/IN our/PRP$ enjoyment.<br/NN /><br/NN />But/. what/WH about/RB Jackman?/NN What/WH about/IN Ian/NN (Swearengen)/RP McShane?/NN I/PRP liked/VB both/DT of/IN them/PRP to/TO the/DT extent/NN that/IN they/PRP are/VB used/VB in/IN the/DT piece./NN I/PRP particularly/RB liked/VB McShane's/NN short/JJ but/CC effective/JJ turns./RP Jackman/NN is/VB charming/JJ with/IN the/DT ease/VB of/RP "Old/RP Money"/NN that/WH was/VB so/RB often/RB portrayed/VB in/IN films/NN from/IN 50/CD years/NN ago./IN (Class/DT echoes/NN from/IN Purple/NN Rose/NN of/RP Cairo?)<br/NN /><br/NN />So/. what/WH did/VB I/PRP think?/VB Short/JJ answer,/NN maybe/RB his/PRP$ best/JJ straight/JJ comedy/NN since/RB 1994's/RP Bullets/NN Over/IN Broadway./NN Less/RB stylized/VB than/RB Mighty/NN Aphrodite./NN Less/RB caustic/VB than/RB Deconstructing/NN Harry./NN Less/RB forced/VB than/IN Small/JJ Time/NN Crooks/NN or/CC Hollywood/NN Ending./NN Woody/NN has/VB finally/RB found/VB a/DT comic/JJ voice/NN that/WH works/VB in/IN the/DT 21st/CD century./NN
