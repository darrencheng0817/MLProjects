The/DT New/NN Batman/NN Adventures/NN (also/NN called/VB Gotham/NN Knights)/NN takes/VB place/VB 5/CD years/NN after/IN the/DT final/JJ episodes/NN of/RP Batman:/NN the/DT Animated/NN Series/NN (B:TAS)/. and/CC only/RB aired/VB for/IN 24/CD episodes./IN This/DT isn't/NN a/DT horrible/JJ show,/NN but/CC it/PRP just/RB isn't/VB as/IN good/JJ as/IN the/DT original/JJ Batman/NN Animated/NN Series./NN I'll/NN start/VB with/IN all/PDT the/DT things/NN that/IN I/PRP found/VB not/RB to/TO be/VB very/RB good.<br/VB /><br/IN />First/DT thing's/NN first,/IN the/DT animation/NN itself:/IN long/JJ and/CC sweet,/RP Gotham/NN isn't/IN dark/JJ anymore,/IN the/DT sky/NN is/VB always/RB bright/JJ red/NN and/CC orange,/RP B:TAS/NN did/VB this/DT also,/NN but/CC it/PRP was/VB drawn/VB on/IN a/DT dark/JJ palate,/NN do/VB the/DT colour/NN of/IN the/DT sky/NN was/VB more/JJ ominous,/NN in/IN this/DT show,/NN the/DT colour/NN of/IN the/DT sky/NN is/VB too/RB bright./VB It/PRP all/RB just/RB looks/VB like/IN any/DT other/JJ kids/NN show/NN and/CC doesn't/NN seem/VB unique/JJ like/VB Batman:/NN TAS/NN did/VB with/IN it's/NN dark,/IN cool/JJ art/NN style/NN on/RP Gotham./NN The/DT art/NN style/NN is/VB OK,/NN but/CC doesn't/NN remind/. me/PRP of/IN Batman/NN anymore./IN Every/DT character/NN is/VB comprised/VB of/IN straight/JJ lines,/NN squares,/. and/CC triangles/NN making/VB characters/NN look/VB less/JJ human-like./NN In/IN the/DT original/JJ series/NN (B:TAS),/NN characters/NN look/VB more/RB like/VB drawn/VB versions/NN of/IN real/JJ people./IN The/DT animation/NN may/MD be/VB more/RB consistent/JJ here/RB than/RB in/RP B:TAS,/NN but/CC it/PRP definitely/RB isn't/VB as/IN good./DT <br/NN /><br/NN />Next:/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT episodes/NN seem/VB too/RB dumbed/VB down/RP and/CC childish,/NN but/CC some/DT of/IN the/DT subject/JJ matter/NN is/VB even/RB stronger/RB than/RB in/RP B:TAS.(Two-Face/NN attempting/VB to/TO kill/VB Tim/NN Drake/Robin/NN 2,/CD and/CC some/DT villains/NN get/VB some/DT pretty/RB harsh/JJ treatment)./IN This/DT leads/VB me/PRP to/TO my/PRP$ next/JJ point.<br/NN /><br/NN />Because/IN this/DT is/VB supposed/VB to/TO take/VB place/NN in/IN the/DT future/JJ as/IN well/RB as/IN the/DT final/JJ episodes/NN of/IN the/DT Batman/NN Animated/NN Universe,/NN many/JJ villains/NN do/VB meet/VB their/PRP$ demise/NN or/CC leave/VB forever./RP Poison/NN Ivy/NN apparently/RB drowns/. when/WH a/DT cruise/NN ship/VB explodes;/RP Two-Face/NN nearly/RB kills/VB Penguin,/NN Killer/NN Croc,/NN and/CC himself,/VB so/RB he's/VB moved/VB to/TO Arkham/NN forever;/RP Joker/NN falls/VB into/IN the/DT exhaust/VB tower/NN of/IN an/DT industrial/JJ plant/NN (though/. he/PRP will/MD return/VB later/RB on/IN the/DT Justice/NN League/NN Animated/NN Series);/NN Catwoman/NN moves/VB away/RP to/TO France/NN leaving/VB Batman,/NN etc.../VB Just/RB because/IN the/DT series/NN is/VB ending/VB does/VB not/RB mean/VB that/IN they/PRP have/VB to/TO get/VB rid/VB of/IN some/DT great/JJ characters!/IN The/DT villains'/NN motives/NN are/VB pretty/RB bad,/VB too./IN There/EX are/VB none!/VB In/RB B:TAS,/NN we/PRP learn/VB that/IN these/DT villains/NN are/VB mentally/RB tormented/. and/CC their/PRP$ lives/NN are/VB ruined,/DT that's/NN why/WH they/PRP act/VB the/DT way/NN they/PRP do,/VB in/IN this/DT show,/NN the/DT villains/NN are/VB just/RB committing/VB crimes/NN to/TO progress/VB the/DT story./RP It's/NN like/IN Batman/NN just/RB doesn't/VB even/RB care/VB about/RB saving/VB whatever/WH sanity/VB there/EX is/VB left/VB in/IN the/DT people/NN that/IN he/PRP fights,/VB he/PRP just/RB beats/VB them/PRP senseless./VB This/DT Batman/NN is/VB a/DT colder/NN and/CC meaner/NN version/NN of/IN the/DT character,/NN but/CC since/IN he's/NN been/VB doing/VB this/DT job/NN for/IN years,/VB I/PRP can/MD see/VB why/WH he/PRP is/VB so/RB harsh./VB <br/DT /><br/NN />Next,/IN the/DT redesigned/NN character/NN models:/IN they're/DT awful./NN Gordon/NN slimmed/VB down/RP about/IN 100/CD pounds.../NN is/VB he/PRP sick?/VB Many/JJ villains/NN look/VB STUPID/NN (Joker,/RP Riddler,/NN Catwoman,/NN Mr./NN Freeze,/NN Mad/NN Hatter,/NN and/CC Killer/NN Croc/NN are/VB among/IN the/DT WORST)./NN Although,/NN I/PRP do/VB think/VB that/IN some/DT characters/NN look/VB better/RB (Bane,/RP Scarecrow,/NN Batgirl)./NN Harley/NN is/VB about/IN the/DT same,/NN and/CC Ivy/NN (who/NN is/VB even/RB hotter/JJ now)/NN has/VB pale/JJ green/JJ skin.<br/NN /><br/NN />With/IN the/DT series/NN having/VB many/JJ faults,/IN some/DT episodes/NN are/VB great-/NN Over/IN the/DT Edge,/NN Mad/NN Love,/NN Beware/NN the/DT Creeper,/NN Girls/NN Night/NN Out,/NN Old/JJ Wounds,/NN Legends/NN of/IN the/DT Dark/NN Knight,/NN and/CC Never/NN Fear/NN are/VB my/PRP$ favourite/NN ones/NN here,/NN in/IN my/PRP$ opinion./NN All/NN of/IN the/DT crossovers/NN featuring/VB Batman/NN in/IN the/DT Superman/NN Animated/NN Series/NN were/VB great,/DT also.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT absolute/JJ WORST/NN part/NN about/IN this/DT show/NN is/VB how/WH the/DT creators/NN say/VB they/PRP love/VB the/DT animation/NN of/IN this/DT series/NN more/RB than/IN the/DT original./NN On/IN the/DT DVD/NN features/NN of/IN the/DT original/JJ Batman/NN Animated/NN Series,/NN they/PRP talk/VB about/IN how/WH proud/JJ they/PRP were/VB with/IN the/DT art/NN style,/. and/CC how/WH difficult/JJ some/DT characters/NN were/VB to/TO animate,/NN but/CC they/PRP did/VB eventually/RB succeed/VB with/IN (the/DT difficult/JJ animation/NN necessary/JJ to/TO animate/PRP$ Clayface,/NN for/IN example)./NN On/IN the/DT DVD/NN features/NN of/IN the/DT New/NN Batman/NN Adventures,/NN the/DT creators/NN basically/RB say/VB "To/RP Hell/NN with/RP B:TAS,/NN this/DT is/VB a/DT fresh,/JJ new/JJ re-vamp,/. it/PRP looks/VB better/JJ and/CC we/PRP love/VB how/WH we/PRP NEARLY/NN RUINED/NN THE/DT SERIES!"/NN (Alright,/. that/WH is/VB an/DT exaggeration)./NN When/WH the/DT creators/NN cast/VB away/RP the/DT amazing/JJ art/NN style/NN of/RP B:TAS,/NN that/IN really/RB annoyed/JJ me!<br/NN /><br/NN />It's/VB not/RB a/DT bad/JJ show,/NN but/CC I/PRP still/RB don't/VB like/IN it/PRP as/RB much/RB as/IN the/DT original/JJ animated/NN series./NN At/IN least/JJ the/DT show/NN doesn't/NN talk/VB down/RP to/TO its/PRP$ audience,/NN so/RB for/IN that/WH reason,/VB I/PRP still/RB commend/VB it./NN Though/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT episodes/NN in/IN this/DT new/JJ series/NN are/VB fantastic/JJ and/CC worth/JJ watching./NN <br/NN /><br/NN />Superman:/IN the/DT Animated/NN Series,/NN and/CC Justice/NN League:/NN the/DT Animated/NN Series/NN are/VB great/JJ follow-up/NN shows/VB to/TO Batman:/NN the/DT Animated/NN Series/NN and/CC The/DT New/NN Batman/NN Adventures,/NN so/RB give/VB them/PRP a/DT watch/NN as/IN well./DT
