Reviewing/NN KAZAAM/NN and/CC saying/VB it's/IN a/DT bad/JJ movie/NN isn't/IN hard/JJ at/IN all--after/DT all,/NN critics/NN at/IN the/DT time/NN it/PRP came/VB out/RP fell/VB all/DT over/IN themselves/PRP excoriating/VB this/DT film--saying/NN it/PRP was/VB among/IN the/DT worst/JJ films/NN of/IN the/DT decade!/NN So/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN I/PRP say/VB it's/DT bad/JJ or/CC anyone/NN else/RB says/VB it's/DT bad/JJ is/VB certainly/RB no/RB surprise./RP It's/NN like/IN someone/NN talking/VB about/RP WWII--practically/NN no/DT one/NN says/VB that/WH was/VB a/FW GOOD/NN thing,/NN right?!/IN The/DT question/NN I/PRP have/VB and/CC no/RB place/VB on/RP IMDb/NN can/MD answer/VB it/PRP is/VB "why/TO did/VB they/PRP make/VB this/DT in/IN the/DT first/JJ place?!"./NN After/IN all,/NN it's/IN obvious/JJ to/TO anyone/NN who/WH isn't/VB severely/RB brain/NN injured/VB that/IN the/DT film/NN would/MD be/VB horrible./RP But,/NN movies/NN like/VB ED/NN (a/NN baseball/NN playing/VB chimp),/RP COOL/NN AS/IN ICE/NN (starring/IN the/DT ever-popular/RP Vanilla/NN Ice),/NN TROLL/NN 2/CD (which/NN doesn't/VB even/RB have/VB any/DT trolls/VB in/RP it),/RP BABY/NN GENIUSES/NN (Einstain-like/IN superhero/DT babies)/NN and/CC PINOCCHIO/NN IN/IN OUTER/NN SPACE/NN (huh!?!)/NN prove/VB that/IN any/DT idea,/NN no/DT matter/NN how/WH dumb,/PRP can/MD make/VB it/PRP to/TO the/DT big/JJ screen!/RP So,/NN the/DT idea/NN of/IN the/DT best/JJ basketball/NN player/NN of/IN the/DT time/NN starring/VB as/IN a/DT genie/NN to/TO an/DT obnoxious/JJ little/JJ brat/NN seems/VB downright/RB 'normal'!/JJ <br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT film/NN starts/VB with/IN a/DT kid/NN who/WH is/VB pretty/RB jerky/VB keying/IN the/DT lockers/NN in/IN the/DT hallway/NN of/IN the/DT school./NN Like/IN the/DT punk/NN from/IN FREE/NN WILLY,/NN this/DT kid/NN is/VB somehow/RB 'misunderstood'/VB (in/DT other/JJ words,/IN a/DT total/JJ brat)/NN and/CC you/PRP know/VB that/IN no/DT matter/NN how/WH selfish/JJ and/CC horrible/JJ he/PRP is,/VB by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT film/NN he'll/NN have/VB learned/VB something/NN and/CC grown./VB Just/RB once,/VB I/PRP want/VB to/TO see/VB a/DT punk/NN kid/NN like/IN this/DT end/NN up/RB in/IN prison/NN or/CC or/CC dead/JJ by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT film!/RP Eventually,/NN while/IN the/DT neighborhood/NN bullies/NN are/VB in/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN pummeling/NN him,/IN the/DT genie/RP Kazaam/NN (Shaquille/RP O'Neal)is/NN accidentally/RB released/VB and/CC insists/VB on/IN giving/VB the/DT brat/NN three/CD wishes./TO But,/NN the/DT kid/NN doesn't/NN believe/VB him/PRP AND/CC the/DT genie's/NN magic/NN seems/VB a/DT tad/NN rusty.<br/NN /><br/NN />Eventually/IN the/DT brat/NN does/VB realize/VB that/WH Kazaam/NN is/VB for/RP real./RP However,/NN unlike/IN most/RB kids,/VB he/PRP withholds/MD making/VB his/PRP$ wishes/NN so,/NN in/IN the/DT meantime,/RP Kazaam/NN is/VB forced/VB to/TO follow/VB him/PRP around/RP everywhere--like/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ personal/JJ servant./RP And,/NN according/VB to/TO the/DT cliché,/NN you/PRP know/VB that/IN by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT film,/NN Max/NN and/CC Kazaam/NN will/MD have/VB become/VB lifelong/JJ buddies/NN and/CC a/DT bunch/NN of/IN tears/NN will/MD be/VB shed./RP Oh,/NN and/CC Max/NN will/MD have/VB come/VB to/TO terms/NN with/IN his/PRP$ absent/JJ father/NN and/CC mom's/NN fiancé/IN (I'm/DT gonna/NN gag)./VB Apparently/RB this/DT genie/NN is/VB a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT social/JJ worker/NN in/IN addition/NN to/TO being/VB a/DT granter/NN of/IN wishes.<br/DT /><br/NN />As/VB for/RP Kazaam,/NN Shaquille/NN speaks/VB in/IN rhyme/NN through/IN much/JJ of/IN the/DT movie/NN and/CC even/RB takes/VB a/DT break/NN to/TO rap...very/VB poorly./RP I'm/NN a/DT middle-aged/JJ white/JJ guy/NN and/CC I/PRP think/VB I/PRP could/MD probably/RB rap/VB at/IN least/JJ as/RB well!/RP He's/NN an/DT amazing/JJ basketball/NN player/NN and/CC I've/NN heard/VB he's/IN a/DT nice/JJ guy--but/IN a/DT rapper...no/NN way!/NN As/IN far/RB as/IN his/PRP$ acting/NN goes,/. he/PRP wasn't/VB great/JJ but/CC had/VB such/PDT a/DT nice/JJ personality/NN in/IN the/DT film/NN that/IN it's/DT hard/JJ to/TO hate/VB him--even/NN if/IN they/PRP made/VB him/PRP do/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN very/RB stupid/JJ things.<br/NN /><br/NN />So/NN is/VB the/DT movie/NN as/IN excruciatingly/DT awful/JJ as/IN you've/NN probably/RB heard?/VB through/IN the/DT first/JJ two-thirds/NN of/IN the/DT movie,/NN I/PRP would/MD have/VB said/VB no./RP Shaquille/NN seemed/VB to/TO try/VB his/PRP$ best/JJ with/IN an/DT unlikable/NN kid/NN and/CC a/DT bad/JJ script./RP However,/NN later/RB in/IN the/DT film,/NN the/DT bad/JJ becomes/VB horrid--as/RP Kazaam/NN seems/VB too/RB concerned/VB with/IN himself/PRP to/TO help/VB the/DT kid/NN when/WH he's/VB really/RB needed./RP And,/NN out/RP of/IN nowhere,/IN the/DT plot/NN gets/VB really,/VB really/RB weird--as/VB the/DT guy/NN who/WH wants/VB to/TO make/VB Kazaam/NN a/DT rap/NN star(?!?!)/NN turns/VB out/RP to/TO be/VB an/DT evil/JJ mobster!/RP And,/NN oddly,/IN this/DT guy/NN seems/VB to/TO accept/VB that/WH Kazaam/NN is/VB a/DT genie/NN with/IN no/DT hesitation!/NN <br/IN /><br/DT />In/NN addition,/IN the/DT last/JJ portion/NN of/IN the/DT film/NN consists/VB of/IN people/NN trying/VB to/TO kill/VB Max/NN and/CC his/PRP$ dad./NN I/PRP know/VB that/IN the/DT kid/NN was/VB annoying,/NN but/CC this/DT is/VB supposed/VB to/TO be/VB a/DT kids'/NN film!!/. What/WH part/NN of/IN 'trying/NN to/TO kill/VB the/DT kid'/NN didn't/IN the/DT writers/NN not/RB understand?!?/RP Then,/NN in/IN an/DT ending/VB that/WH makes/VB this/DT perhaps/RB the/DT worst/JJ kids/NN film/NN ending/VB in/RP history,/RP Kazaam/NN becomes/VB god/NN or/CC something/NN and/CC it/PRP all/RB was/VB like/IN a/DT drug-induced/NN hallucination!/IN This/DT ending/VB was/VB even/RB dumber/JJ and/CC weirder/NN than/IN the/DT one/CD in/IN THE/DT BLACK/NN HOLE...and/NN boy,/NN did/VB it/PRP make/VB my/PRP$ brain/NN hurt!!/RP Uggghh--the/NN horrible/JJ dialog/NN was/VB just/RB too/RB much/RB to/TO bear!!!<br/VB /><br/DT />Overall,/NN it's/IN a/DT terrible/JJ film/NN that/WH is/VB due/RB mostly/RB to/TO writers/NN who/WH were/VB certifiably/VB insane./RP Yes,/NN folks,/NN with/IN a/DT messed/NN up/IN message,/DT bizarre/JJ non-kid/NN friendly/JJ material/NN and/CC horrible/JJ characters,/IN this/DT is/VB one/PRP wretched/VB film./RP Sadly,/NN given/VB the/DT idea/NN and/CC actors,/NN it's/IN hard/JJ to/TO imagine/VB the/DT final/JJ product/NN turning/VB out/RP much/JJ worse!!<br/NN /><br/NN />By/IN the/DT way,/NN if/IN you/PRP want/VB to/TO see/VB a/FW Genie/NN in/IN a/DT modern/JJ world/NN film/NN that/WH is/VB GOOD,/NN try/VB the/DT British/NN made/VB for/IN TV/NN film/NN "Bernard/. and/CC the/DT Genie"--a/NN charming/JJ and/CC exceptionally/RB well-written/JJ film/NN from/IN start/VB to/TO finish./VB
