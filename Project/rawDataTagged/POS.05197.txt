There/EX is/VB an/DT episode/NN of/IN The/VB Simpsons/NN which/WH has/VB a/DT joke/NN news/NN report/NN referring/VB to/TO an/DT army/NN training/NN base/NN as/IN a/DT "Killbot/RP Factory"./NN Here/RB the/DT comment/NN is/VB simply/RB part/NN of/IN a/DT throwaway/NN joke,/. but/CC what/WH Patricia/NN Foulkrod's/NN documentary/NN does/VB is/VB show/VB us,/DT scarily,/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VB not/RB that/IN far/RB from/IN the/DT truth./NN After/IN World/NN War/NN Two/CD the/DT US/NN Army/NN decided/VB to/TO tackle/VB a/DT problem/NN they/PRP faced/VB throughout/IN the/DT war;/NN that/IN many/JJ soldiers/NN got/VB into/IN battle/NN and/CC found/VB themselves/PRP totally/RB unable/JJ to/TO kill/VB another/DT human/JJ being/NN unless/IN it/PRP was/VB a/DT matter/NN of/IN 'me/NN or/CC them'./NN Since/IN then/RB the/DT training/NN process/NN of/IN the/DT US/NN army/NN has/VB been/VB to/TO remove/VB all/DT moral/JJ scruples/NN and/CC turn/VB recruits/VB into/IN killing/NN machines/NN who/WH don't/MD think/VB of/IN combatants/NN as/IN people./NN To/TO develop/VB in/IN them/PRP a/DT most/JJ unnatural/NN state:/IN "The/DT sustainable/JJ urge/NN to/TO kill".<br/VB /><br/DT />First/NN off,/IN this/DT isn't/NN an/DT antiwar/NN movie/NN as/RB such./RP Whilst/NN it/PRP certainly/RB paints/NN war/NN in/IN a/DT very/RB bad/JJ light,/RP Foulkrod/NN focuses/VB rather/RB on/IN an/DT aspect/NN that/IN doesn't/NN get/VB as/IN much/JJ media/NN attention/NN as,/NN say,/IN the/DT debate/NN over/IN the/DT legality/NN of/IN a/DT war/NN or/CC it's/DT physical/JJ successes/NN or/CC failures;/VB the/DT affect/VB the/DT process/NN of/IN turning/VB a/DT man/NN into/IN a/DT soldier/NN has/VB on/IN that/DT person/NN as/IN a/DT human/JJ being./RP It's/NN the/DT paradox/NN that/WH to/TO train/VB someone/NN to/TO be/VB a/DT soldier/NN to/TO defend/VB society/NN makes/VB them/PRP totally/RB unsuitable/VB to/TO live/VB as/IN part/NN of/IN that/DT society/NN themselves,/. and/CC whilst/VB most/RB of/IN the/DT examples/NN and/CC interviewees/NN are/VB from/IN the/DT current/JJ Middle/NN East/NN conflict/NN Foulkrod/NN makes/VB the/DT links/NN to/TO past/JJ conflicts,/NN especially/RB Vietnam,/NN painfully/RB clear./VB This/DT isn't/NN about/IN any/DT particular/JJ war,/NN it's/NN about/IN the/DT problems/NN caused/VB by/IN war/NN in/IN general.<br/DT /><br/NN />Structurally/IN the/DT film/NN seems/VB to/TO be/VB split/VB into/IN three/CD sections;/. how/WH recruits/VB are/VB drawn/VB into/IN the/DT army/NN and/CC the/DT training/NN they/PRP receive,/VB how/WH they/PRP are/VB treated/VB once/RB they/PRP are/VB in/IN combat,/NN and/CC what/WH happens/VB once/RB they/PRP leave/VB the/DT army./NN Once/IN this/DT point/NN is/VB reached/VB you/PRP realise/VB that/IN the/DT main/JJ target/NN of/IN this/DT film/NN is/VB actually/RB the/DT policies/NN that/WH are/VB inherent/JJ in/IN the/DT armed/JJ forced,/NN policies/NN that/WH are/VB put/VB into/IN place/NN to/TO make/VB soldiers/NN into/IN an/DT affective/NN combat/NN force/NN but/CC removing/VB all/DT humanity/NN from/IN the/DT individuals./NN Those/DT interviewed/VB tell/VB the/DT camera/NN how/WH the/DT recruiting/NN process/NN seems/VB so/RB clean/JJ and/CC simple,/NN how/WH word/NN like/IN "democracy"/NN and/CC "freedom"/NN are/VB banded/VB around,/NN but/CC once/RB the/DT training/NN begins/VB they/PRP become/VB "enemy"/NN and/CC "kill"/NN and/CC "destroy"./NN How/WH once/RB in/IN action/NN soldiers/NN don't/NN care/NN what/WH they/PRP are/VB ordered/VB to/TO do,/VB as/IN they/PRP are/VB ingrained/NN with/IN the/DT idea/NN that/IN as/RB soon/RB as/IN they/PRP carry/VB out/RP an/DT order,/NN whatever/WH it/PRP may/MD be,/VB they/PRP are/VB one/CD step/NN closer/RB to/TO going/VB home./IN They/PRP have/VB no/DT political/JJ or/CC social/JJ ideals/NN to/TO fight/VB for/IN but/CC fight/NN and/CC kill/VB as/IN that's/NN what/WH they've/MD been/VB trained/VB to/TO do.<br/VB /><br/NN />But/IN The/DT Ground/NN Truth's/NN main/JJ goal/NN is/VB to/TO highlight/VB the/DT way/NN the/DT US/NN Army/NN discards/IN those/DT who/WH have/VB fought/VB for/IN their/PRP$ country/NN once/IN they/PRP return/VB home./IN There/EX is/VB no/DT real/JJ rehabilitation/NN given/VB to/TO soldiers/NN returning,/. and/CC many/JJ are/VB forced/VB to/TO go/VB home/RB unable/JJ to/TO cope/VB with/IN what/WH they/PRP have/VB seen/VB and/CC done,/NN and/CC most/JJ policies/NN in/IN place/NN seem/VB to/TO be/VB to/TO make/VB sure/RB the/DT army/NN has/VB no/DT legal/JJ responsibility/NN whatsoever/RB for/IN psychological/JJ affects/VB their/PRP$ soldiers/NN pick/VB up./IN This/DT is/VB the/DT final/JJ indignity,/NN that/IN once/RB they/PRP are/VB used/VB they/PRP are/VB cast/VB away.<br/DT /><br/NN />If/. there/EX is/VB a/DT flaw/NN in/IN the/DT film/NN it/PRP is/VB that/WH Foulkrod/NN doesn't/NN attempt/NN to/TO show/VB another/DT side/NN to/TO the/DT argument./NN You/PRP would/MD get/VB the/DT impression/NN that/IN every/DT single/JJ soldier/NN who/WH ever/RB went/VB to/TO war/NN would/MD come/VB back/RP with/IN Post/NN Traumatic/NN Stress/NN Syndrome./NN It/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VB interesting/JJ to/TO see/VB those/DT of/IN aÂ…/DT less/JJ liberal/JJ upbringing/NN give/VB their/PRP$ opinions/NN of/IN how/WH the/DT army/NN handles/VB training/NN and/CC
