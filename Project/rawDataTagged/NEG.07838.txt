POSSIBLY/NN VERY/NN MINOR/JJ SPOILERS<br/NN /><br/IN />This/DT movie/NN is/VB billed/VB as/IN the/DT first/JJ Russian/JJ horror/NN movie./RP Unfortunately,/NN as/IN far/RB as/IN I/PRP am/VB concerned,/VB "The/RP Witch"/NN (its/IN Russian/JJ title)/NN will/MD take/VB a/DT place/NN of/IN dishonor/NN in/IN the/DT gallery/NN of/IN horrible/JJ Russian/NN movies./. It/PRP is/VB based/VB on/RP Nikolai/NN Gogol's/NN story/NN "Viy"/. which/WH is/VB a/DT classic/JJ in/RP Russia./NN "Based"/NN is/VB the/DT key/JJ word/NN here/RB since/IN no/DT familiarity/NN with/IN

quite/RB used/VB to/TO directors/NN taking/VB stories/NN from/IN other/JJ cultures/NN and/CC adapting/NN them/PRP to/TO their/PRP$ own/JJ culture./IN The/DT spate/NN of/IN American/JJ remakes/NN of/IN

was/VB shot/VB in/RP Estonia/NN in/IN English/NN with/IN the/DT aim/NN of/IN dubbing/VB it/PRP into/IN English/NN using/VB American/JJ actors/NN and/CC have/VB reasonably/RB synchronous/JJ lip/JJ

staggers/NN on/IN until/IN he/PRP finds/VB a/DT dilapidated/NN house/NN and/CC is/VB rather/RB un-welcomed/VB by/IN an/DT old/JJ crone./IN All/DT that/WH to/TO the/DT accompaniment/NN of/IN a/DT

I/PRP mention/VB that/IN it's/DT raining/NN really/RB hard?/VB After/IN a/DT few/JJ supposedly/RB frightening/JJ scenes/NN which/WH had/VB me/PRP laughing,/VB the/DT story/NN finds/VB our/PRP$

the/DT prop/VB department./IN The/DT dialog/NN which/WH I/PRP heard/VB in/IN Russian/NN was/VB clearly/RB originally/RB written/VB in/RP English,/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VB compiled/VB exclusively/RB from/IN clichés/NN and/CC platitudes/NN picked/VB from/IN American/NN films./IN The/DT actors/NN just/RB as/RB clearly/RB struggled/VB with/IN English/NN because/IN the/DT timing/NN of/IN their/PRP$ speech/NN was/VB labored/NN and/CC unnatural,/NN and/CC the/DT Russian/JJ dubbing/NN followed/VB suit./IN The/DT acting/NN is/VB mostly/RB atrocious,/. and/CC not/RB only/RB because/IN the/DT actors/NN find/VB it/PRP often/RB difficult/JJ to/TO talk/VB but/CC because/IN they/PRP don't/MD have/VB anything/NN approaching/VB a/DT range/NN of/IN facial/JJ expressions./NN For/IN the/DT most/JJ part,/NN they're/VB just/RB blank/JJ or/CC you/PRP wish/VB they/PRP were./VB The/DT only/JJ exceptions/NN being/VB the/DT sheriff/NN played/VB by/RP Lembit/NN Ulfsak,/NN a/DT fine/JJ Estonian/NN

testimony/NN to/TO the/DT general/JJ quality/NN of/IN acting/VB in/IN the/DT film.<br/NN /><br/NN />There/NN wasn't/IN a/DT single/JJ scary/JJ moment/NN in/IN the/DT entire/JJ film,/NN and/CC there/EX wasn't/VB a/DT single/JJ original/JJ moment/NN in/IN the/DT film/NN either./RP Mind/NN you,/IN this/DT comment's/NN coming/VB from/IN somebody/NN who's/VB rather/RB inexperienced/JJ with/IN horror./IN The/DT film/NN is/VB filled/VB with/IN standard/JJ moves/NN used/VB in/IN horror/NN movie/NN since/IN the/DT genre's/NN inception./NN At/IN a/DT critical/JJ moment,/IN the/DT camera/NN lingers/VB lovingly/NN on/IN a/DT kerosene/NN lamp./IN The/DT lamp/NN promptly/RB goes/VB out./IN It/PRP must/MD have/VB seen/VB a/DT few/JJ horror/NN movies,/NN too./IN An/DT example/NN of/IN supreme/JJ

a/DT mystical/NN thriller./. I/PRP wasn't/VB thrilled/TO either./VB It/PRP was/VB run-of-the-mill/NN from/IN start/VB to/TO finish./VB I/PRP particularly/RB enjoyed/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT entire/JJ population/NN of/IN the/DT little/JJ town/NN behaved/VB as/RB if/IN they/PRP knew/VB exactly/RB they/PRP lived/VB in/IN a/DT horror/NN movie,/NN except/IN they/PRP weren't/VB quite/RB sure/JJ whether/IN it/PRP had/VB zombies/NN or/CC not./RP Therefore,/NN some/RB of/IN them/PRP acted/VB zombie-like/VB just/RB in/IN case./DT <br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT makers/NN of/IN the/DT film/NN say/VB it's/VB about/RB finding/VB faith./IN Such/PDT a/DT fine/JJ collections/NN of/IN idiotic/DT actions,/NN stupidly/IN contrived/DT moments,/NN and,/IN yes,/DT clichés,/NN doesn't/NN deserve/VB to/TO be/VB about/RB finding/VB faith./IN The/DT movie/NN is/VB so/RB thoroughly/. and/CC utterly/RB fake/JJ it/PRP deserves/VB only/RB to/TO be/VB an/DT exhibit/NN in/IN a/DT wax/NN figure/NN museum./NN
