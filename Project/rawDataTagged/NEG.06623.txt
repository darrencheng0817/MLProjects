Johnny's/NN best/JJ friend/NN and/CC talking/VB dog,/IN one/PRP of/RP Dexter's...I/NN mean,/NN Susan/NN and/CC Mary's/NN early/JJ experiments.<br/NN /><br/IN />Dexter's/DT Laboratory/NN was/VB

/><br/DT />Let's/NN talk/NN about/IN how/WH the/DT show/NN doesn't/VB completely/RB rip/VB off/RP Dexter's/NN Lab./NN The/DT show/NN tosses/NN in/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN characters,/NN from/IN two/CD
