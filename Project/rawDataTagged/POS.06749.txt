The/DT cinematic/JJ interests/NN in/IN the/DT British/JJ monarchy/NN continues/VB with/IN The/DT Young/NN Victoria/NN (1837/VB to/TO 1901),/VB after/IN having/VB seen/VB in/IN recent/JJ years,/IN

Elizabeth/NN had/VB enough/RB to/TO span/VB two/CD films./TO However,/NN The/DT Young/JJ Victoria,/NN as/IN the/DT title/NN already/RB suggests,/VB is/VB a/DT lite-version/NN of/IN the/DT young/JJ

their/PRP$ dealings/NN with/IN shady,/DT self-serving/NN politicians,/VB unfortunately/RB there's/JJ nothing/NN of/IN depth/NN here.<br/IN /><br/DT />That's/NN not/RB to/TO say/VB The/DT Young/NN Victoria/NN is/VB without./RP Directed/NN by/IN Canadian/JJ Jean-Marc/NN Vallee/NN (best/NN known/VB for/RP CRAZY)/NN and/CC written/VB by/RP Julian/NN Fellowes,/NN this/DT film/NN chronicles/VB in/IN

the/DT other,/NN are/VB they/PRP really/RB acting/VB in/IN her/PRP$ interests,/NN or/CC in/IN the/DT interests/NN of/IN others?<br/DT /><br/NN />Even/IN this/DT angle/NN of/IN intrigue/DT creeps/NN into/IN her/PRP$ romantic/JJ story/NN with/IN Prince/NN Albert/NN (Rupert/RP Friend),/NN where/WH their/PRP$ relationship/NN forms/VB the/DT bulk/NN of/IN the/DT second/JJ half/NN of/IN the/DT

Instead/RB of/IN being/VB pawns,/NN there's/IN this/DT constant/JJ search/NN and/CC probing/VB of/IN opportunities/NN to/TO break/VB out/RP of/IN stifling,/NN and/CC at/IN times/NN absurd,/NN rules/NN

/><br/NN />However,/IN all/PDT these/DT themes/NN become/VB but/CC a/DT breeze/NN through/IN the/DT narrative,/NN from/IN childhood/NN to/TO romance,/VB marriage/NN and/CC children./NN In/IN fact,/DT there's/NN so/RB much/JJ fast-forwarding/NN here,/VB especially/RB the/DT last/JJ few/JJ minutes/NN filled/VB with/IN inter-titles,/NN that/IN it/PRP actually/RB leaves/VB the/DT audience/NN wanting/VB for/IN more,/NN and/CC room/NN of/IN course/NN for/IN another/DT movie,/NN which/WH I/PRP suspect/VB would/MD probably/RB not/RB see/VB the/DT light/NN of/IN day,/NN but/CC perhaps/RB a/DT
