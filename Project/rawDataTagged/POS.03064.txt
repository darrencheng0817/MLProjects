The/DT British/JJ production/NN company/NN Amicus/NN is/VB generally/RB known/VB as/IN the/DT specialist/NN for/IN horror/NN anthologies,/. and/CC this/DT great/JJ omnibus/NN called/VB "The/DT

ravishing/RP Ingrid/NN Pitt/NN star/NN in/IN this/DT film/NN -/. so/RB which/WH true/JJ Horror/NN fan/NN could/MD possibly/RB afford/VB to/TO miss/VB it?/IN No/DT one,/NN of/IN course,/NN and/CC the/DT film/NN has/VB much/RB more/JJ to/TO offer/VB than/IN just/RB a/DT great/JJ cast./NN "The/NN House/NN That/WH Dripped/NN Blood"/NN revolves/NN around/IN an/DT eerie/JJ rural/JJ mansion,/NN in/IN which/WH strange/JJ things/NN are/VB happening./NN In/IN four/CD parts,/IN the/DT film/NN tells/VB the/DT tales/NN of/IN four/CD different/JJ heirs.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT first/JJ tale,/NN

After/IN moving/VB in,/IN the/DT writer/NN suddenly/RB feels/VB haunted/VB by/IN a/DT maniac/NN of/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ creation.../IN The/DT first/JJ segment/NN is/VB a/DT great/JJ kickoff/NN to/TO

"Sweets/VB To/TO The/DT Sweet"/NN is/VB by/IN far/RB the/DT creepiest/NN and/CC most/RB brilliant/JJ of/IN the/DT four./NN John/NN Reed/NN (Christopher/RP Lee)/NN moves/NN in/IN with/IN his/PRP$

(Jon/RP Pertwee)/NN moves/NN into/IN the/DT house/NN with/IN his/PRP$ sexy/JJ mistress/co-star/NN Carla/NN (Ingrid/RP Pitt)./NN This/DT fourth/JJ story/NN is/VB satire,/DT more/JJ than/IN it/PRP is/VB
