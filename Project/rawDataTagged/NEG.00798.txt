Near/IN the/DT closing/NN stages/NN of/IN Baby/NN Mama,/NN one/CD of/IN the/DT central/JJ characters/NN goes/VB on/RP to/TO describe/VB the/DT basic/JJ outline/NN of/IN everything/NN that/WH came/VB

relevant/JJ and/CC too/RB unremarkable/VB to/TO be/VB worth/JJ anyone's/NN time./IN A/DT lacklustre/NN cast,/IN mundane/DT script/NN and/CC vague,/NN caricature/VB characters/NN ensure/VB that/IN Baby/NN Mama/NN certainly/RB isn't/JJ taxing/NN on/IN the/DT ol'/NN noggin,/. but/CC it/PRP never/RB makes/VB up/RP for/IN this/DT through/IN its/PRP$ proposed/JJ sense/NN of/RB humour./RP Consisting/NN mainly/RB of/IN very/RB routine,/VB cliché/DT jokes/NN based/VB around/IN an/DT odd/JJ couple/NN (rich/. and/CC poor)/NN trying/VB to/TO live/VB with/IN each/DT other/JJ as/IN they/PRP prepare/VB to/TO bring/VB a/DT baby/NN into/IN the/DT world,/NN the/DT film/NN is/VB far/RB too/RB esoteric/JJ to/TO deliver/VB laughs/VB outside/IN its/PRP$ very/RB thin/JJ demographic.<br/NN

the/DT comedy-orientated/JJ odd/JJ couple/NN tangent,/NN characterisation/NN is/VB notably/RB weak,/VB resulting/VB in/IN a/DT lukewarm/NN romance/NN that/IN never/RB bubbles./VB As/IN characters/NN

their/PRP$ emptiness;/NN so/RB while/IN we/PRP may/MD eventually/RB come/VB to/TO find/VB the/DT character's/NN interactions/NN with/IN each/DT other/JJ amusing/JJ at/IN times,/IN the/DT comedy/NN

rarely/RB stems/VB outside/JJ of/IN the/DT typical/JJ confines/NN of/IN the/DT odd-couple/NN formula.<br/NN /><br/NN />Kate/VB (Tina/RP Fey)/NN is/VB a/DT successful/JJ business/NN woman/NN who/WH
