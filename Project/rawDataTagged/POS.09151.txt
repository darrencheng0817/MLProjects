I/PRP have/VB to/TO say,/VB as/IN a/FW BSG/NN fan/NN I/PRP wasn't/VB exactly/RB sure/RB what/WH I'd/NN think/VB of/IN this/DT show./NN I/PRP saw/VB it/PRP on/IN the/DT big/JJ screen/NN at/IN the/DT Arclight/NN cinema/NN tonight/NN (as/NN part/NN of/IN the/DT Paley/NN Center/NN screenings),/. and/CC the/DT cast/NN and/CC film/NN makers/NN spoke/VB after-wards./DT Ron/NN Moore/NN said/VB they/PRP 'wanted/VB to/TO make/VB a/DT clean/JJ break/NN from/IN Battlestar,/NN and/CC do/VB something/NN different,/. and/CC that/WH yes/RB they/PRP would/MD lose/VB some/DT fans/NN but/CC hopefully/RB they'd/JJ gain/NN others"./IN <br/DT /><br/NN />Even/NN without/IN their/PRP$ talk,/NN I/PRP am/VB now/RB a/DT fan/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ show./NN But/CC here's/NN what/WH I/PRP thought/VB of/IN the/DT film.<br/NN /><br/NN />I/NN loved/VB it./IN It/PRP was/VB really/RB very/RB good./VB I/PRP guess/VB I'm/NN a/DT true/JJ sci-fi/NN (or/NN 'syfy'/NN -/. do/VB I/PRP really/RB have/VB to/TO type/NN that?)/NN geek,/VB because/RB I'd/NN totally/RB watch/VB this/DT as/IN a/DT series./NN It/PRP has/VB a/DT strong/JJ and/CC rich/JJ story,/NN and/CC kept/VB my/PRP$ interest./NN <br/IN /><br/DT />It/NN starts/VB with/IN a/DT small/JJ group/NN of/IN teenagers/NN plotting/VB something,/. which/WH to/TO me/PRP was/VB the/DT weakest/JJ part/NN and/CC a/DT bit/NN confusing./IN The/DT actor/NN playing/VB "Ben"/PRP should/MD have/VB given/VB us/PRP more/RB of/IN a/DT glimpse/NN into/IN his/PRP$ intense/JJ beliefs./IN The/DT actress/NN playing/VB "Zoe"/TO seemed/VB a/DT little/JJ posy,/NN but/CC she/PRP was/VB playing/VB a/DT teenager/VB (and/RP I'm/NN sure/RB I/PRP won't/MD be/VB the/DT only/JJ one/NN who/WH thought/VB "Zoe"/TO was/VB a/DT cylon/NN at/IN first,/DT perils/NN of/IN being/VB a/FW BSG/NN geek)./NN If/IN they're/NN hoping/VB these/DT will/MD be/VB the/DT new/JJ Bamber/Helfer/Park,/NN they/PRP may/MD want/VB to/TO rethink/VB it./RP Surprisingly,/NN it/PRP was/VB the/DT adults/NN that/WH captured/VB the/DT audiences/NN attention.<br/NN /><br/IN />Eric/DT Stoltz/NN gives/VB a/DT stellar/JJ performance/NN as/IN Daniel/NN Greystone,/NN a/DT man/NN so/RB haunted/VB by/IN his/PRP$ family/NN tragedy/NN that/IN he/PRP jumps/VB at/IN the/DT first/JJ chance/NN of/IN getting/VB out/RP of/IN his/PRP$ grief/NN and/CC doesn't/NN let/VB go./IN He/PRP does/VB a/DT chilling/JJ and/CC enthralling/NN job/NN of/IN conveying/VB his/PRP$ character's/NN sly/NN knowledge/NN of/IN the/DT inner/JJ world/NN of/IN computers/NN and/CC people,/VB especially/RB in/IN a/DT scene/NN in/IN which/WH he/PRP spins/VB a/DT web/NN for/IN the/DT young/JJ teenage/NN friend/NN of/IN his/PRP$ daughters,/NN traps/NN her,/VB then/RB dismisses/. and/CC releases/NN her./IN No/DT sign/NN at/IN all/DT of/IN the/DT 'serial/NN killer'/. he/PRP played/VB on/RP Gray's/NN Anatomy,/NN really/RB impressive/JJ acting.<br/NN /><br/NN />Equally/NN as/IN strong/JJ though/IN not/RB in/IN it/PRP nearly/RB as/RB much/RB is/VB Paula/NN Malcomson/NN as/IN his/PRP$ wife/NN Amanda/NN Greystone./NN She/PRP is/VB just/RB as/IN smart/JJ and/CC well/RB written/VB and/CC beautifully/NN played/VB as/RB Stoltz's/NN part,/. and/CC I/PRP completely/RB believed/VB that/IN they/PRP are/VB a/DT couple,/NN and/CC a/DT couple/NN that/WH have/VB been/VB together/RB forever/RB and/CC have/VB a/DT strong/JJ relationship,/NN something/NN rarely/RB seen/VB these/DT days./NN I/PRP look/VB forward/RB to/TO seeing/VB what/WH happens/VB with/IN this/DT family,/NN and/CC hope/VB they/PRP give/VB her/PRP as/RB much/RB to/TO do/VB as/RB Roslin/NN in/RP BSG-/NN she/PRP is/VB strong/JJ and/CC smart/JJ and/CC when/WH she/PRP lashes/VB out/RP at/IN her/PRP kid,/VB you/PRP cringe,/MD it's/VB really/RB great./VB Not/RB to/TO mention/VB her/PRP$ eyes,/NN which/WH could/MD hold/VB magical/JJ powers,/NN that's/. how/WH intense/JJ they/PRP are./VB The/DT scene/NN where/WH she/PRP takes/VB on/IN the/DT government/NN agent-/VB very/RB short/JJ scene,/NN but/CC beautifully/NN played-/VB really/RB gives/VB you/PRP an/DT idea/NN of/IN her/PRP$ power.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT other/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT show/NN that/WH did/VB not/RB work/VB 100%/NN for/IN me/PRP were/VB the/DT scenes/NN with/RP Esai/NN Morales,/NN and/CC the/DT mafia/NN type/NN clan/NN of/IN his./VB He/PRP does/VB a/DT good/JJ job/NN overall,/. but/CC I/PRP did/VB not/RB believe/VB in/IN this/DT mobs/NN power,/. nor/CC intimidated/VB by/IN their/PRP$ threats./NN I/PRP found/VB myself/PRP wishing/VB that/IN this/DT whole/JJ story/NN line/NN was/VB a/DT bit/NN more/JJ mysterious/NN and/CC hard/JJ to/TO figure/VB out;/IN the/DT way/NN it/PRP is/VB presented/VB is/VB almost/RB an/DT homage/NN to/TO the/DT Godfather,/NN they/PRP kind/RB of/IN hit/VB you/PRP over/IN the/DT head/NN with/IN it/PRP a/DT bit./NN But/CC given/VB time,/IN I/PRP can/MD see/VB how/WH this/DT will/MD develop/VB into/IN an/DT interesting/JJ 'Upstairs/downstairs'/NN kind/NN of/IN thing,/NN with/IN the/DT poor/JJ minorities/NN (Morales/. et/FW al)/NN versus/IN the/DT rich/JJ folk/NN who/WH rule/VB the/DT planet/NN (Stolz/. et/FW al)./NN And/CC to/TO be/VB honest,/IN I/PRP did/VB enjoy/VB it/PRP when/WH he/PRP spoke/VB to/TO his/PRP$ son/NN about/IN the/DT origin/NN of/IN their/PRP$ name-/NN that/WH was/VB a/DT very/RB well/RB played/VB scene.<br/IN /><br/DT />Note/NN to/TO BSG/NN fans,/IN the/DT boy/NN playing/VB 'Willy/RP Adama'/NN doesn't/VB really/RB look/VB much/RB like/VB Olmos,/NN but/CC he's/VB just/RB a/DT kid./NN Whether/NN or/CC not/RB he'll/VB be/VB featured/VB any/DT more/JJ than/IN he/PRP was/VB in/IN this/DT film,/NN who/WH knows?/VB I/PRP sure/RB couldn't/JJ tell./NN But/CC it/PRP didn't/MD bother/VB me,/NN because/IN he/PRP wasn't/VB as/IN interesting/JJ as/IN everything/NN else/RB going/VB on/RP around/IN him.<br/DT /><br/NN />Polly/NN Walker/NN plays/VB 'Sister/RP Clarice',/NN and/CC she's/DT chilling/JJ and/CC odd/JJ in/IN every/DT scene/NN she's/VB in./RP I'm/NN not/RB sure/RB where/WH she'll/MD go/VB or/CC who/WH she'll/MD end/VB up/RP with,/. but/CC I/PRP was/VB very/RB impressed/VB with/IN her/PRP$ acting./NN In/IN this/DT film/NN she/PRP was/VB sort/NN of/IN on/IN the/DT side,/NN but/CC obviously/RB being/VB set/VB up/RP to/TO play/VB a/DT very/RB important/JJ part/NN later/RB on./VB She/PRP was/VB nothing/NN like/IN her/PRP$ character/NN in/IN "Rome",/DT something/NN I/PRP always/RB find/VB impressive/JJ in/IN actors.<br/NN /><br/IN />One/DT nice/JJ surprise-/IN the/DT music/NN is/VB actually/RB better/JJ and/CC less/RB obvious/JJ than/RB BSG,/NN even/RB though/RB it's/VB the/DT same/JJ guy/NN doing/VB it,/DT Bear/JJ McCreary./NN It/PRP has/VB a/DT haunting/VB and/CC unusual/JJ approach/NN that/WH took/VB me/PRP by/RP surprise,/RP I'd/NN buy/VB this/DT score/NN if/IN I/PRP had/VB the/DT chance.<br/NN /><br/NN />As/VB to/TO the/DT 'panel/NN discussion'/NN after/IN the/DT show,/NN it/PRP was/VB hosted/VB by/IN Seth/NN Green./NN Ron/NN Moore/NN was/VB very/RB smart/JJ and/CC articulate,/NN David/NN Eick/NN was/VB cracking/DT wise/JJ (much/NN like/IN his/PRP$ video/NN diaries),/RP Esai/NN Morales/NN told/VB a/DT long/JJ story/NN about/IN how/WH he/PRP was/VB cast,/NN and/CC Eric/NN Stoltz/NN was/VB very/RB funny/JJ and/CC didn't/VB really/RB answer/VB the/DT questions/NN (/. but/RB I've/NN always/RB had/VB a/DT thing/NN for/RP him)./RP Paula/NN Malcomson/NN was/VB tough/JJ (she/NN took/VB Seth/NN Green/NN to/TO task/NN for/IN mistakenly/RB saying/VB she/PRP was/VB on/IN '24'),/NN and/CC the/DT girls/NN who/WH played/VB Zooey/NN and/CC Lacey/NN were/VB both/DT darling./NN Grace/NN Park/NN and/CC Tricia/NN Helfer/NN were/VB there/RB as/IN well,/DT answering/NN questions/NN about/IN how/WH they/PRP did/VB the/DT scenes/NN acting/VB with/IN themselves/PRP on/RP BSG./NN Overall/RB a/DT very/RB interesting/JJ and/CC wonderful/JJ evening.<br/NN /><br/NN />I'm/NN giving/VB the/DT show/VB a/DT 9/CD out/RB of/RP 10,/CD and/CC very/RB much/RB looking/VB forward/RB to/TO watching/VB it/PRP all/PDT unfold.<br/DT /><br/NN />NOTE:/. I/PRP just/RB watched/VB this/DT a/DT second/JJ time/NN and/CC really/RB hope/VB they/PRP explore/VB what/WH the/DT HOLOBAND/NN was/VB originally/RB made/VB for./IN I/PRP have/VB no/DT idea/NN what/WH that/WH may/MD be,/VB but/CC it/PRP holds/VB a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN fascination/NN to/TO me./VB
