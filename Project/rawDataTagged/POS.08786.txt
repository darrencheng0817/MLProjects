Feroz/NN Abbas/NN Khan's/NN Gandhi/NN My/PRP$ Father,/NN a/DT film/NN that/IN sheds/DT light/NN on/IN the/DT fractured/JJ relationship/NN between/IN the/DT Mahatma/NN and/CC his/PRP$ son/NN Harilal/NN Gandhi./NN For/IN a/DT story/NN that's/NN as/IN dramatic/JJ as/IN the/DT one/CD this/DT film/NN attempts/NN to/TO tell,/VB it's/IN a/DT pity/NN the/DT director/NN fails/VB to/TO tell/VB it/PRP dramatically./RP Gandhi/NN My/PRP$ Father/NN is/VB narrated/VB to/TO you/PRP like/VB that/IN boring/JJ history/NN lesson/NN that/WH put/VB you/PRP to/TO sleep/VB at/IN school./NN Now/RB the/DT film/NN aims/VB to/TO convey/VB one/PRP very/RB interesting/JJ point/NN -/. the/DT fact/NN that/WH Gandhi/NN in/IN his/PRP$ attempt/NN to/TO be/VB a/DT fair/JJ person,/NN ended/VB up/RB being/VB an/DT unfair/JJ father./IN This/DT point/NN is/VB made/VB in/IN the/DT film/NN many/JJ times/NN over,/. and/CC one/CD of/IN the/DT examples/NN given/VB to/TO make/VB this/DT point/NN is/VB that/IN scholarship/NN to/TO England,/NN which/WH Gandhi/NN twice/RB denies/VB his/PRP$ son./NN Instead/RB of/IN showing/VB us/PRP how/WH exactly/RB Harilal/NN dealt/VB with/IN this/DT betrayal/NN and/CC what/WH went/VB on/RP in/IN his/PRP$ head,/NN the/DT director/NN just/RB moves/VB along/RP with/IN the/DT story,/NN thus/RB never/RB letting/VB us/PRP be/VB witness/NN to/TO the/DT growing/JJ resentment/NN Harilal/NN feels/VB towards/IN his/PRP$ father./NN Which/WH is/VB why/WH when/WH we/PRP finally/RB see/VB an/DT outburst/NN from/IN Harilal,/NN it/PRP comes/VB off/RB looking/VB like/IN he's/DT over-reacting./NN <br/IN /><br/DT />The/NN point/VB I'm/NN trying/VB to/TO make/VB here/RB is/VB that/IN we/PRP never/RB really/RB get/VB to/TO understand/VB exactly/RB why/WH Harilal/NN became/VB the/DT rebel/NN that/IN he/PRP did./VB We/PRP never/RB really/RB understand/VB why/WH he/PRP turned/VB to/TO Islam,/NN and/CC then/RB back/RB again/RB to/TO Hinduism./NN The/DT thing/NN is,/. we/PRP never/RB really/RB understand/VB Harilal/NN at/IN all./NN And/CC that's/NN because/IN the/DT director/NN of/IN this/DT film/NN is/VB too/RB busy/JJ focusing/VB on/RP Mohandas/NN Karamchand/NN Gandhi/NN and/CC his/PRP$ role/NN in/IN the/DT freedom/NN struggle,/IN a/DT story/NN most/RB of/IN us/PRP are/VB already/RB familiar/JJ with./NN To/TO put/VB it/PRP simply,/RP Gandhi/NN My/PRP$ Father/NN promises/VB to/TO examine/VB the/DT strained/JJ father-son/NN relationship,/. but/CC it/PRP doesn't/VB so/RB much/RB as/RB show/VB us/PRP where/WH the/DT cracks/NN in/IN this/DT relationship/NN first/RB set/VB in./IN We/PRP understand/VB Harilal/NN had/VB to/TO live/VB with/IN the/DT burden/NN of/IN being/VB Gandhi's/NN son,/. but/CC show/VB us/PRP why/WH that/WH was/VB a/DT burden/NN to/TO begin/VB with./DT Show/NN us/PRP incidents/NN of/IN their/PRP$ early/JJ conflict./NN For/IN example,/DT it's/NN not/RB enough/RB that/WH Gandhi/NN merely/RB says/VB he's/TO opposed/VB to/TO Harilal's/NN early/JJ marriage,/NN tell/VB us/PRP why/WH this/DT opposition?/RP It's/NN not/RB enough/RB that/WH Kasturba/NN blames/VB her/PRP$ husband/NN for/IN the/DT way/NN her/PRP$ son/NN turned/VB out/RP -/. for/IN constantly/RB shuttling/VB him/PRP between/IN schools/NN in/RP Gujarat/NN and/CC South/JJ Africa,/NN for/IN making/VB him/PRP relocate/VB every/DT time/VB Gandhi/NN needed/VB to/TO relocate./PRP$ Words/NN are/VB not/RB enough,/VB show/VB us/PRP how/WH these/DT incidents/NN shaped/VB the/DT character/NN of/RP Harilal/NN Gandhi.What's/NN more,/VB instead/RB of/IN sticking/NN with/IN the/DT prickly/JJ theme/NN of/IN this/DT tenuous/JJ Gandhi/NN versus/IN Gandhi/NN relationship,/IN the/DT film/NN goes/VB off/RP on/IN too/RB many/JJ tangents,/NN thus/RB diluting/VB the/DT impact/NN of/IN the/DT central/JJ theme./IN This/DT was/VB never/RB meant/VB to/TO be/VB a/DT film/NN about/IN the/DT struggle/NN for/RP Independence,/NN and/CC yet/RB on/IN many/JJ occasions/NN that's/VB exactly/RB what/WH it/PRP seems/VB like,/NN because/IN the/DT director/NN feels/VB almost/RB obligated/VB to/TO take/VB us/PRP through/IN all/PDT the/DT main/JJ events/NN leading/VB upto/IN that/DT historic/JJ moment,/NN even/RB though/RB much/RB of/IN it/PRP has/VB no/DT relevance/NN to/TO the/DT film's/JJ basic/JJ premise/NN -/. the/DT stormy/JJ father-son/NN relationship./NN So/IN you/PRP see/VB the/DT problem/NN with/IN this/DT film/NN is/VB not/RB that/WH it's/VB a/DT bad/JJ film,/NN but/CC it's/VB certainly/RB a/DT very/RB confused/JJ film./NN What/WH happens/VB to/TO Harilal's/NN children/NN after/IN his/PRP$ wife's/NN death?/NN Does/VB he/PRP ever/RB have/VB relationship/NN with/IN them?/NN Where/WH do/VB they/PRP suddenly/RB vanish/VB after/IN that/DT one/CD scene/NN in/IN which/WH we/PRP see/VB them/PRP with/IN the/DT Mahatma/NN and/CC Kasturba?/NN None/NN of/IN these/DT questions/NN are/VB answered/VB in/IN a/DT film/NN that's/VB basically/RB meant/VB to/TO be/VB about/IN relationships/NN in/IN the/DT Gandhi/NN family./IN The/DT film/NN version/NN of/IN an/DT immensely/RB popular/JJ play/NN directed/VB by/RP Feroz/NN Abbas/NN Khan/NN himself,/RP Gandhi/NN My/PRP$ Father/NN is/VB a/DT disappointment,/NN no/DT questions/NN asked.Cinematically,/. it/PRP struggles/VB to/TO translate/VB the/DT filmmaker's/JJ ambitious/JJ

leading/VB into/IN each/DT other./NN On/IN the/DT positive/JJ side,/. there/EX is/VB inherent/JJ nobility/NN in/IN the/DT film,/NN which/WH you/PRP recognise./VB The/DT filmmaker/NN makes/VB every/DT effort/NN to/TO deliver/VB a/DT balanced/JJ narrative,/NN trying/VB hard/RB not/RB to/TO take/VB sides,/VB never/RB once/RB judging/VB either/DT father/NN or/CC son,/NN painting/NN neither/CC as/IN the/DT villain./NN What/WH the/DT film/NN does/VB do,/DT however,/NN is/VB make/VB clear/VB the/DT fact/NN that/WH Gandhi/NN was/VB a/DT difficult/JJ patriarch/NN whose/WH$ ideals/NN may/MD have/VB shaped/VB the/DT nation,/NN but/CC evidently/RB alienated/VB his/PRP$ family./NN Of/IN all/PDT the/DT actors/NN in/IN the/DT film/NN it's/VB only/RB Akshaye/NN Khanna/NN who/WH really/RB shines/VB in/IN the/DT role/NN of/IN the/DT luck-deprived/RP Harilal/NN Gandhi./NN It's/NN a/DT wonderful/JJ performance,/NN and/CC it's/VB not/RB easy/JJ since/IN the/DT role/NN covers/VB virtually/RB the/DT

he/PRP conveys/VB through/IN body/NN language/NN alone./RP Darshan/NN Jariwala,/NN meanwhile,/. who/WH plays/VB Gandhi/NN Senior,/NN adopts/VB a/DT caricaturish/NN approach/NN to/TO playing/VB the/DT Mahatma/NN in/IN his/PRP$ later/JJ years,/NN but/CC it's/VB the/DT way/NN he/PRP humanises/VB the/DT man/NN in/IN his/PRP$ early/JJ years/NN as/IN a/DT barrister/NN in/IN South/NN Africa/NN that/WH is/VB the/DT actor's/JJ best/JJ contribution/NN to/TO that/WH role./VB The/DT abundantly/JJ gifted/JJ Shefali/NN Shah/NN plays/VB Kasturba,/NN the/DT woman/NN who's/NN meant/VB to/TO be/VB torn/VB in/IN this/DT father-son/NN conflict,/. but/CC if/IN she's/DT unable/JJ to/TO bring/VB across/IN that/DT feeling/NN of/IN helplessness/NN then/RB it's/VB really/RB not/RB so/RB much/RB her/PRP$
