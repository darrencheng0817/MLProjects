This/DT movie/NN had/VB potential,/NN but/CC what/WH makes/VB it/PRP really/RB bad/JJ is/VB Lindsay/NN Crouse's/NN acting./RP I've/NN never/RB seen/VB her/PRP before/RB in/IN anything/NN else/RB and/CC maybe/RB there/EX are/VB some/RB Crouse/NN fans/NN out/IN there/EX that/WH like/VB her/PRP in/IN something/NN else,/. but/CC her/PRP$ performance/NN in/IN this/DT movie/NN is/VB bad.<br/IN /><br/DT />Her/NN delivery/NN is/VB robotic./.
