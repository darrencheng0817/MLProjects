For/IN some/DT reason,/NN this/DT film/NN has/VB never/RB turned/VB up/RP in/IN its/PRP$ original/JJ language/NN in/IN my/PRP$ neck/NN of/IN the/DT woods/NN (despite/NN owning/VB the/DT TCM/NN UK/NN Cable/NN channel,/. which/WH broadcasts/NN scores/NN of/IN MGM/NN titles/NN week/NN in/IN week/NN out)./IN More/JJ disappointingly,/NN it's/VB still/RB M.I.A./NN on/RP DVD/NN /VB even/RB from/IN

40th/JJ anniversary/NN of/IN his/PRP$ passing/NN <br/IN /><br/DT />I/NN say/VB this/DT because/IN the/DT film/NN allows/VB him/PRP a/DT rare/JJ villainous/NN role/NN as/IN a/DT selfish/JJ

buffaloes;/IN an/DT opening/NN statement/NN offers/VB the/DT alarming/JJ statistic/NN that/IN the/DT population/NN of/IN this/DT species/NN was/VB reduced/VB from/IN 60,000,000/CD to/TO 3,000/CD in/IN

(1953),/IN another/DT bleak/JJ open-air/NN MGM/NN Western./NN The/DT film,/NN in/IN fact,/DT ably/NN approximates/VB the/DT flavor/NN and/CC toughness/VB of/RP Mann's/NN work/NN in/IN this/DT field/NN (despite/NN being/VB writer/director/RP Brooks'/NN first/JJ of/IN just/RB a/DT handful/NN of/IN such/JJ outings/NN but/CC which,/NN cumulatively,/NN exhibited/IN a/DT remarkable/JJ diversity);/NN here,/NN too,/IN the/DT narrative/NN throws/VB in/IN a/DT female/JJ presence/NN (Debra/RP Paget,/NN also/RB a/DT half-breed)/NN to/TO be/VB contended/VB between/IN the/DT two/CD rugged/NN leads/VB /NN and/CC Granger,/NN like/IN the/DT James/NN Stewart/NN of/IN THE/DT NAKED/NN SPUR,/NN returns/NN to/TO his/PRP$ job/NN only/RB grudgingly/VB (his/DT remorse/NN at/IN having/VB to/TO kill/VB

MADRE/NN (1948),/. he/PRP becomes/VB diffident/NN and/CC jealous/NN of/IN his/PRP$ associates,/NN especially/RB with/IN respect/NN to/TO a/DT rare/JJ /NN and,/IN therefore,/DT precious/JJ /NN hide/VB of/IN a/DT white/JJ buffalo/NN they've/NN caught;/. he/PRP even/RB goes/VB buffalo-crazy/NN at/IN one/CD point/NN (as/NN Nolan/NN had/VB predicted),/TO becoming/VB deluded/NN into/IN taking/VB the/DT rumble/VB of/IN thunder/NN for/IN the/DT hooves/NN of/IN an/DT approaching/VB mass/NN of/IN the/DT species!/NN The/DT hunting/NN scenes/NN themselves/PRP are/VB impressive/JJ /NN buffaloes/NN
