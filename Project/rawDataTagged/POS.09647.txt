A/DT blockbuster/NN at/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN it's/DT original/JJ release/NN (it/NN was/VB the/DT second-highest/JJ grossing/VB film/NN of/IN 1976),/IN the/DT third/JJ screen/NN version/NN of/IN A/DT STAR/NN IS/VB BORN/NN has/VB always/RB divided/VB critics/NN and/CC fans/NN alike./IN The/DT film/NN open/VB to/TO scathingly/VB negative/JJ reviews,/NN however,/IN $5.6/DT million-budgeted/NN picture/NN went/VB on/RP to/TO gross/JJ over/IN $150/$ million/CD at/IN the/DT box/NN office/NN and/CC won/VB an/DT Academy/NN Award/NN and/CC five/CD Golden/JJ Globes./NN It's/NN not/RB without/IN some/DT irony/NN that/WH Streisand's/NN most/RB commercially/RB successful/JJ film/NN would/MD also/RB remain/VB her/PRP$ most/JJ controversial./NN For/IN every/DT ten/NN fans/NN who/WH state/NN that/WH STAR/NN is/VB Streisand's/NN best/RB film,/. there/EX are/VB always/RB ten/VB more/RB who/WH claim/VB it/PRP is/VB the/DT weakest/JJ film/NN in/IN her/PRP$ filmography./NN Although/IN both/DT

of/IN the/DT most/RB touching/VB and/CC highly/RB entertaining/JJ showbiz/NN dramas/NN that/IN Hollywood/NN ever/RB produced./VB For/IN my/PRP$ money,/NN it's/IN the/DT best/JJ version/NN of/IN the/DT often-told/NN tale.<br/IN /><br/DT />The/NN film/NN is/VB solidly/RB enjoyable/JJ and/CC throughly/NN absorbing./NN Changing/VB the/DT setting/NN from/IN the/DT old/JJ Hollywood/NN studio/NN system/NN to/TO the/DT competitive/JJ world/NN of/IN the/DT music/NN industry/NN was/VB actually/RB a/DT great/JJ idea,/NN and/CC the/DT screenplay/NN forges/IN a/DT realistic/JJ contrast/NN between/IN the/DT

classic/JJ predecessors./NN For/IN example,/IN the/DT film/NN is/VB especially/RB successful/JJ when/WH depicting/VB the/DT clashing/JJ personal/JJ and/CC professional/JJ difficulties/NN during/IN

more/JJ believable/NN in/IN it's/DT portrayal/NN of/IN the/DT lead/JJ characters./NN For/IN example,/IN the/DT female/NN leads/VB in/IN the/DT two/CD previous/JJ versions/NN were/VB so/RB virtuous/. and/CC self-sacrificing/NN that/IN they/PRP came/VB off/RP as/IN saints./NN On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand,/RP Esther,/NN the/DT female/JJ lead/NN in/IN this/DT version,/NN is/VB not/RB only/RB

the/DT fine/JJ line/NN between/IN tough/JJ and/CC vulnerable/JJ without/IN making/VB herself/PRP seem/VB like/IN a/DT script/NN contrivance,/NN Streisand/NN is/VB definitely/RB the/DT girl/NN you/PRP

Kris/NN Kristofferson/NN may/MD not/RB get/VB much/JJ respect/NN now/RB for/IN his/PRP$ laid-back/NN characterization,/IN however,/DT he's/NN always/RB interesting/JJ watch/NN and/CC displays/NN a/DT

NEWSWEEK,/NN TIME,/NN and/CC even/RB the/DT NEW/JJ YORKER's/NN usually/RB vicious/JJ Pauline/NN Kael./NN Gary/NN Busey/NN and/CC Paul/NN Mazursky/NN also/RB give/VB believable/DT performances,/NN but/CC both/DT have/VB a/DT fairly/RB minimal/JJ amount/NN of/IN screen/NN time.<br/IN /><br/DT />The/NN film's/NN soundtrack/NN recording/NN was/VB also/RB a/DT massive/JJ success,/NN hitting/VB the/DT #1/VB on/RP Billboard's/NN Hot/NN 200/CD and/CC selling/VB over/IN four/CD million/CD copies/NN in/IN the/DT US/NN alone./IN The/DT Streisand-composed/NN "Evergreen"/IN (with/DT lyrics/NN from/IN Paul/NN Williams)/NN is/VB unarguably/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT most/JJ gorgeous/NN songs/NN in/IN contemporary/JJ pop,/NN brought/VB to/TO even-further/VB life/NN by/IN an/DT absolutely/RB

pretty/RB good/JJ as/IN well,/NN and/CC Streisand/NN sounds/VB fantastic/JJ -/. her/PRP live/VB solo/JJ numbers/NN remain/VB in/IN the/DT memory/NN long/RB after/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT movie/NN has/VB faded./RP Streisand's/NN vibrant/JJ performances/NN bring/VB "Woman/NN In/IN The/DT Moon"/NN and/CC "With/$ One/CD More/RB Look/VB At/IN You"/NN to/TO thrilling/VB life,/NN and/CC make/VB even/RB sillier/JJ numbers/NN like/VB "Queen/RP Bee"/NN work/VB far/RB better/RB than/IN they/PRP have/VB the/DT right/NN to./RP Kristofferson's/NN solo/NN numbers/NN sound/VB somewhat/RB tuneless,/JJ however,/NN that/WH may/MD have/VB been/VB intentional/JJ since/IN he/PRP is/VB playing/VB a/DT singer/NN in/IN decline.<br/DT /><br/NN />Though/VB naturally/RB dated/VB in/IN some/DT
