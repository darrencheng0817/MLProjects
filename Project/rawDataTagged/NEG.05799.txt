DARK/NN REMAINS/NN is/VB a/DT low/JJ budget/NN American/NN horror/NN movie/NN that/IN somehow/RB managed/VB to/TO win/VB 2/CD awards.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT plot/NN seems/VB to/TO involve/VB 2/CD separate/VB strands./RP First,/NN a/DT woman/NN commits/VB suicide/NN by/IN slashing/VB her/PRP$ wrists/NN whilst/VB bathing./RP Second,/NN the/DT young/JJ daughter/NN of/IN a/DT technical/JJ writer/NN is/VB found/VB with/IN her/PRP$ throat/NN slashed./IN The/DT grieving/NN couple/NN decide/VB to/TO move/VB to/TO an/DT isolated/JJ cabin/NN in/IN the/DT mountains./NN It/PRP later/RB transpires/VB that/IN the/DT cabin/NN and/CC surrounding/VB locations/NN are/VB haunted.<br/DT /><br/NN />As/IN the/DT movie/NN goes/VB on,/IN the/DT 2/CD separate/JJ strands/NN of/IN story/NN eventually/RB converge/VB as/IN one/PRP might/MD reasonably/RB expect./RP However,/NN the/DT execution/NN is/VB haphazard/NN and/CC results/NN in/IN confusion/NN that/WH could/MD perhaps/RB only/RB be/VB resolved/VB by/IN multiple/JJ viewings./RP Unfortunately,/NN the/DT movie/NN is/VB simply/RB not/RB enticing/VB enough/RB to/TO attract/VB most/JJ viewers/NN into/IN watching/VB it/PRP more/RB than/IN once.<br/DT /><br/NN />Just/NN about/IN everything/NN that/WH could/MD go/VB wrong/JJ with/IN this/DT movie/NN goes/VB wrong/JJ -/. and/CC fast!/NN And/CC the/DT low/JJ budget/NN cannot/NN be/VB used/VB to/TO justify/VB all/DT of/IN the/DT shortcomings/NN found/VB here.<br/IN /><br/DT />I/NN believe/VB it/PRP would/MD be/VB wrong/JJ to/TO pass/VB judgement/NN on/IN the/DT actors/NN involved/VB in/IN this/DT production/NN as/IN the/DT material/NN was/VB simply/RB too/RB poor.<br/VB /><br/IN />The/DT characters/NN are/VB uninteresting/VB as/RB pointed/VB out/RP by/IN other/JJ reviewers/NN on/IN this/DT site./NN The/DT badly/RB written/VB script/NN introduces/VB too/RB many/JJ people/NN without/IN giving/VB them/PRP interesting/JJ dialogue,/NN without/IN creating/VB opportunities/NN for/IN character-driven/DT situations/NN and/CC without/IN adding/VB depth/NN to/TO any/DT of/IN them.<br/DT /><br/NN />The/NN direction/NN is/VB uninspired./IN The/DT inspiration/NN from/IN J-Horror/NN movies/NN such/JJ as/RB RINGU,/NN THE/DT GRUDGE/NN and/CC ONE/NN MISSED/NN CALL/NN is/VB evident./RP Unfortunately,/NN the/DT directors/NN of/RP DARK/NN REMAINS/NN did/VB not/RB pay/VB close/JJ attention/NN to/TO the/DT style/NN of/RP J-Horror./NN J-Horror/NN works/VB so/RB effectively/RB because/IN it/PRP plays/VB on/IN fear/NN of/IN the/DT unknown./RP Tension/NN is/VB created/VB by/IN constant/JJ shifts/NN between/IN a/DT bizarre/JJ situation/NN (a/NN ghost/NN on/IN a/FW CCTV/NN camera/NN walking/VB towards/IN it/PRP for/IN example),/NN and/CC the/DT reaction/NN of/IN a/DT central/JJ character/NN who/WH is/VB faced/VB with/IN it/PRP without/IN any/DT warning./NN There/EX is/VB no/DT humour/NN or/CC tongue-in-cheek/JJ element/NN in/IN these/DT movies./NN Everything/NN is/VB played/VB so/RB straight/JJ and/CC without/IN remorse/NN or/CC limitations/NN that/IN you/PRP can't/MD help/VB but/CC be/VB convinced/JJ and/CC captivated/NN by/IN it./IN The/DT foreboding/NN atmospheres/NN set/VB up/RP the/DT suspense/NN and/CC ensures/VB the/DT horror/NN has/VB psychological/JJ impact,/NN very/RB much/RB unlike/IN the/DT "jump/NN scares"/NN used/VB in/IN Hollywood/NN movies.<br/IN /><br/DT />The/NN directors/NN of/RP DARK/NN REMAINS/NN made/VB a/DT brave/NN attempt/NN to/TO avoid/VB Hollywood/NN clichés/. and/CC also/RB successfully/RB avoided/VB using/VB CGI./NN The/DT homage/NN to/TO J-Horror/NN could/MD have/VB been/VB well/RB intended./RP Unfortunately,/NN the/DT lack/NN of/IN inspiration/NN is/VB likely/JJ to/TO make/VB the/DT viewer/NN laugh/NN at/IN the/DT supposed/VB "scares"/NN on/IN the/DT screen./NN The/DT make-up/NN effects/NN of/IN the/DT "ghosts"/NN weren't/VB too/RB bad/JJ given/VB the/DT low/JJ budget/NN but/CC their/PRP$ actions/NN just/RB defied/VB logic./IN I/PRP was/VB scratching/VB my/PRP$ head/NN quite/RB a/DT few/JJ times/NN during/IN this/DT movie.<br/NN /><br/IN />I/DT couldn't/NN give/VB away/RP the/DT ending/VB even/RB if/IN I/PRP wanted/VB to./IN I/PRP simply/RB couldn't/VB understand/VB it./IN All/DT I/PRP could/MD deduce/VB was/VB that/IN it/PRP was/VB something/NN of/IN an/DT anti-climax.<br/NN /><br/NN />What/NN remains?/IN The/DT answer/NN as/IN a/DT reviewer/NN on/IN a/DT different/JJ website/NN has/VB pointed/VB out/RP is/VB boredom./IN The/DT movie/NN is/VB a/DT chore/NN to/TO sit/VB through./RP Thankfully,/NN the/DT pain/NN ends/VB after/IN an/DT hour/NN and/CC a/DT half./RP However,/NN most/RB would/MD probably/RB switch/VB off/RP long/RB before/IN the/DT end.<br/NN /><br/NN />There/NN are/VB only/RB 2/CD positive/JJ things/NN I/PRP could/MD find/VB in/IN this/DT movie/NN -/. the/DT successful/JJ avoidance/NN of/IN scare/NN clichés/. and/CC the/DT absence/NN of/IN the/DT "f-word"/NN in/IN every/DT single/JJ sentence/NN like/IN one/PRP would/MD normally/RB expect/VB to/TO find./VB This/DT is/VB what/WH the/DT 2/CD stars/NN are/VB for.<br/DT /><br/NN />Those/. who/WH like/VB supernatural/NN or/CC psychological/JJ horror/NN relating/VB to/TO ghosts/NN and/CC haunting/VB might/MD do/VB well/RB to/TO stick/VB to/TO movies/NN such/JJ as/IN THE/DT LEGEND/NN OF/IN

see/VB an/DT obscure/JJ ultra-low/NN budget/NN "R-rated"/NN horror/NN movie/NN about/IN ghosts,/NN watch/VB DEATH/NN OF/IN A/DT GHOST/NN HUNTER./NN It/PRP may/MD not/RB be/VB the/DT greatest/JJ horror/NN movie/NN ever/RB made/VB but/CC it/PRP is/VB surely/RB a/DT lot/NN better/RB than/RB DARK/NN REMAINS/NN and/CC does/VB have/VB a/DT few/JJ genuine/JJ surprises/NN in/IN store.<br/DT /><br/NN
