Noting/VB the/DT cast,/NN I/PRP recently/RB watched/VB this/DT movie/NN on/RP TCM,/NN hoping/VB for/IN an/DT under-appreciated/NN gem,/NN as/IN I/PRP regard/VB many/JJ films/NN from/IN the/DT 30's./NN This/DT is/VB no/DT gem/NN -/. not/RB even/RB semi-precious./VB The/DT anachronistic/NN clothing/NN and/CC 1930's/NN Rolls/NN Royce/NN limo/NN hit/VB you/PRP immediately./VB The/DT casting/NN is/VB strange,/DT also./NN But/CC mostly,/VB there/EX are/VB too/RB many/JJ dumb/JJ and/CC unnecessary/JJ plot/NN devices./IN This/DT film/NN has/VB lots/NN of/IN good/JJ ingredients/NN and/CC a/DT basic/JJ plot/NN that/WH holds/VB promise,/NN but/CC the/DT components/NN aren't/NN mixed/VB according/VB to/TO the/DT right/NN recipe./. It/PRP simply/RB doesn't/VB come/VB together/RB like/IN it/PRP should./VB And/CC that's/VB a/DT shame./RP WIth/NN a/DT few/JJ rather/RB obvious,/. but/CC minor/JJ alterations,/IN this/DT might/MD have/VB been/VB a/DT very/RB good/JJ movie.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT film/NN is/VB about/IN an/DT American/NN showgirl/VB (Jean/RP Harlow)/NN seeking/VB a/DT rich/JJ British/JJ husband/NN -/. preferably/RB from/IN the/DT nobility./NN She/PRP meets/VB Franchot/NN Tone/NN and/CC his/PRP$ buddy,/NN who/WH are/VB on/IN a/DT lark/NN in/IN a/DT Rolls/NN Royce/NN owned/VB by/IN his/PRP$ buddy's/NN employer./RP Harlow/NN mistakenly/RB assumes/VB Tone/NN is/VB the/DT Lord/NN who/WH owns/VB the/DT Rolls,/NN and/CC she/PRP sets/VB her/PRP$ sights/NN on/IN him./IN This/DT early/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT film/NN is/VB a/DT light/JJ comedy/NN of/IN no/DT real/JJ distinction./NN <br/NN /><br/VB />However,/RP Tone/NN unwittingly/NN uncovers/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN his/PRP$ employer/NN is/VB actually/RB a/DT German/JJ 5th/NN columnist/NN on/IN the/DT eve/NN of/RP WWI,/NN and/CC that/WH is/VB when/WH the/DT movie/NN changes/NN tone/NN altogether/RB and/CC begins/VB to/TO fall/VB apart./RP Tone/NN and/CC Harlow/NN are/VB married,/NN but/CC just/RB as/IN the/DT honeymoon/NN begins,/. he/PRP is/VB gunned/VB down/RP by/IN a/FW Mata/NN Hari-type/NN (Benita/RP Hume),/NN and/CC Harlow/NN flees/IN the/DT scene,/NN with/IN a/DT bystander/NN accusing/VB her/PRP of/RP Tone's/NN murder./NN (In/VB fact,/RP Tone/NN recovers/NN from/IN the/DT wounds.)<br/NN /><br/IN />Harlow/DT flees/NN to/TO France,/NN where/WH she/PRP falls/VB in/IN love/NN again/RB -/. this/DT time/NN with/IN a/DT wealthy/JJ French/NN cad/VB (Cary/RP Grant)./NN Tone,/NN now/RB in/IN the/DT army,/NN and/CC Harlow/NN are/VB unexpectedly/RB brought/VB back/RB together/RB in/RP Grant's/NN hospital/NN room/NN where/WH he/PRP is/VB in/IN rehab/NN from/IN a/DT plane/NN crash./NN In/IN the/DT following/VB scene,/RP Tone/NN accuses/VB Harlow/NN of/IN abandoning/VB him/PRP because/IN she/PRP is/VB essentially/RB a/DT gold-digger./RP Harlow/NN never/RB explains/VB about/IN the/DT witness'/NN accusing/VB her/PRP of/IN murder/NN and/CC her/PRP panic!/VB That/DT is/VB one/CD of/IN those/DT unreal,/NN movie-plot-device/NN break-downs/NN in/IN the/DT story.<br/NN /><br/VB />Then/RP Tone/NN is/VB also/RB brought/VB back/RP into/IN contact/NN with/IN the/DT woman/NN (Hume)/. who/WH shot/VB him./IN She/PRP is/VB on/IN hand/NN to/TO watch/VB her/PRP paramour,/RP Grant,/NN test/VB the/DT new/JJ plane/NN that/WH Tone/NN has/VB delivered/VB to/TO him/PRP from/IN England./NN Incredibly,/NN both/DT Hume/NN and/CC Tone/NN dimly/NN recognize/VB each/DT other,/NN but/CC simply/RB can't/JJ place/NN where/WH from!/TO Okay,/NN so/RB Tone/NN was/VB shot/NN and/CC almost/RB died;/VB perhaps/RB his/PRP$ memory/NN is/VB a/DT little/JJ out/RP of/IN whack./NN But/CC how/WH many/JJ men/NN did/VB Hume/NN shoot/VB that/IN she/PRP would/MD forget/VB one/CD of/IN her/PRP$ marks?/NN (She/NN does/VB not/RB seem/VB to/TO be/VB faking/IN the/DT memory/NN lapse.)<br/IN /><br/DT />This/NN is/VB inexplicable/JJ and/CC unnecessary./RP Hume/NN should/MD have/VB absolutely/RB recognized/VB him,/NN but/CC played/VB it/PRP coy/JJ when/WH she/PRP realized/VB that/WH Tone/NN wasn't/IN able/JJ to/TO place/VB her./IN That/DT would/MD have/VB been/VB a/DT much/JJ better/JJ treatment/NN of/IN that/DT issue.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT finale/NN also/RB is/VB very/RB unsatisfying./VB The/DT movie,/NN as/IN made,/NN has/VB Tone/NN and/CC Harlow/NN conspiring/VB to/TO preserve/VB the/DT good/JJ reputation/NN of/IN the/DT cad,/RP Grant,/NN leading/VB to/TO his/PRP$ fraudulent/JJ burial/NN as/IN a/DT hero./NN

unsatisfying/VB as/IN a/DT love/NN story!<br/NN /><br/NN />What/IN the/DT film/NN begs/NN for/IN is/VB this:/RP Harlow/NN explains/VB that/IN she/PRP fled/VB in/IN a/DT panic/NN in/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN accusations/NN of/RB murder;/RP Tone/NN forgives/. her/PRP and/CC quietly/RB rekindles/VB his/PRP$ love/NN for/IN her;/VB he/PRP then/RB carries/VB a/DT torch/NN for/IN her,/NN even/RB while/IN

having/VB seen/VB Tone/NN for/IN the/DT brave/NN and/CC noble/JJ man/NN he/PRP is,/RP Harlow/NN rekindles/NN feelings/NN for/IN him,/DT too./NN At/IN film's/NN end,/IN the/DT two/CD of/IN them/PRP
