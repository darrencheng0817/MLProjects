German/JJ filmmaker/RP Ulli/NN Lommel/NN has/VB managed/VB a/DT task/NN many/JJ horror/NN fans/NN thought/VB was/VB impossible:/IN he's/DT unseated/JJ fellow/JJ Teuton/NN Uwe/NN Boll/NN for/IN the/DT crown/NN of/IN director/NN of/IN the/DT worst/JJ horror/NN film/NN ever/RB made.<br/VB /><br/DT />Lommel/NN is/VB truly/RB the/DT Ed/NN Wood/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ millennium./IN This/DT film/NN is/VB as/IN shoddy/NN and/CC laughable/NN as/IN the/DT best-worst/VB of/RP EW./NN I/PRP am/VB both/DT proud/JJ and/CC embarrassed/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN I/PRP watched/VB it/PRP in/IN toto,/DT morbidly/NN fascinated/VB to/TO see/VB just/RB low/JJ the/DT bar/NN could/MD be/VB set./IN The/DT answer/NN is:/VB subterranean;/RP Lommel/NN dug/VB a/DT pit/NN and/CC buried/VB it.<br/IN /><br/DT />The/NN fun/NN begins/VB with/IN the/DT cast/NN of/IN international/JJ nobodies./NN Only/RB someone/NN who/WH has/VB lived/VB in/IN Los/NN Angeles,/NN where/WH every/DT auto/NN mechanic,/NN doctor/NN and/CC mailman/NN is/VB an/DT actor/NN or/CC screenwriter/NN waiting/VB to/TO be/VB discovered,/PRP could/MD easily/RB understand/VB how/WH Lommel/NN managed/VB to/TO find/VB so/RB many/JJ wannabe/NN actors/NN willing/JJ to/TO spew/VB his/PRP$ ridiculous/JJ dialog/NN with/IN a/DT straight/JJ face.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT main/JJ character,/IN a/DT villainous/NN beat/VB cop,/TO is/VB played/VB by/IN a/DT German/JJ actor/NN with/IN a/DT thick/JJ German/JJ accent./NN Aside/RB from/IN being/VB a/DT serial/NN killer,/. he/PRP is/VB also/RB the/DT oldest/JJ beat/VB cop/NN in/RP LA./NN Despite/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN he/PRP stops/VB innocent/JJ women/NN drivers/NN and/CC takes/VB them/PRP into/IN custody,/NN then/RB drags/VB them/PRP into/IN his/PRP$ home/NN (which/VB inexplicably/RB is/VB the/DT top/JJ floor/NN of/IN a/DT furniture/NN warehouse),/. and/CC does/VB all/PDT this/DT in/IN plain/JJ sight/NN of/IN his/PRP$ rookie/NN partners,/IN the/DT LAPD/NN refuses/VB to/TO investigate,/VB going/VB so/RB far/RB as/RB to/TO physically/RB attack/VB one/CD of/IN his/PRP$ accusers/NN in/IN a/DT ninja/NN style/NN raid/NN on/IN his/PRP$ apartment.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT sets/NN are/VB excruciatingly/NN bad./IN The/DT production/NN designer's/NN budget/NN apparently/RB included/VB just/RB enough/JJ money/NN for/IN a/DT can/NN of/IN paint;/DT enough/JJ to/TO paint/VB "Precinct/DT 707"/NN on/IN a/DT cardboard/NN wall.<br/NN /><br/NN />Since/IN the/DT actors/NN were/VB obviously/RB unpaid/JJ non-professionals--a/NN sad/JJ assortment/NN of/IN European/JJ emigres/NN (possibly/NN deportees/NN if/IN they/PRP acted/VB in/IN their/PRP$ native/JJ lands),/NN bimbos,/NN mimbos,/. and/CC desperate/JJ middle-aged/JJ women--and/NN since/IN little/JJ if/IN any/DT money/NN

rental.<br/IN /><br/DT />More/NN than/IN half/NN of/IN the/DT story/NN focuses/VB on/IN the/DT dirty/JJ deeds/NN of/IN our/PRP$ deranged/JJ German/JJ LAPD/NN officer/NN and/CC the/DT futile/JJ efforts/NN of/IN two/CD young/JJ rookies/NN to/TO stop/VB him./IN One/CD of/IN these/DT young/JJ actors/NN is/VB especially/RB pitiable/VB because/IN he's/IN the/DT only/JJ actor/NN in/IN this/DT whole/JJ mess/NN with/IN even/RB a/DT vague/JJ shot/NN at/IN a/DT real/JJ career/NN in/IN the/DT movies./NN The/DT other/JJ fits/VB right/JJ in,/NN with/IN a/DT rockabilly/NN hairdo/. and/CC tortured/RP Brando/NN posing/VB that/WH needs/VB to/TO be/VB seen/VB to/TO be/VB appreciated.<br/DT /><br/NN />The/IN latter/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT film/NN is/VB where/WH the/DT title/NN gets/VB its/PRP$ zombie,/NN as/IN the/DT victims/NN of/IN our/PRP$ killer/NN are/VB resurrected/VB after/IN he/PRP murders/VB a/DT girl/NN who/WH had/VB just/RB visited/VB some/DT voodoo/NN priestesses/VB to/TO have/VB a/DT protective/JJ spell/NN put/VB on/RP her./RP Don't/NN ask/VB why/WH a/DT girl/NN from/IN Romania/NN would/MD resort/VB to/TO voodooism/VB in/IN anticipation/NN of/IN being/VB murdered,/VB just/RB accept/VB Lommel's/NN logic/NN and/CC enjoy/VB the/DT absurd/JJ ride.<br/NN /><br/NN />After/VB much/RB prolonged/VB hand-clawing/VB out/RP of/IN straw-covered/DT roadside/NN graves,/IN the/DT zombie/NN girls/NN manage/VB to/TO make/VB their/PRP$ appearance./NN They/PRP look/VB exactly/RB as/IN they/PRP did/VB before/IN death,/NN maybe/RB even/RB prettier,/VB with/IN

for/IN the/DT runway.<br/NN /><br/NN />At/IN this/DT point/NN in/IN the/DT movie/NN Lommel/NN borrows/VB a/DT creative/JJ note/NN from/IN his/PRP$ lauded/VB countryman/RP Boll,/NN and/CC injects/DT large/JJ doses/NN of/RB cheesy/RP Euro-trash/NN techno/NN into/IN the/DT soundtrack./RP We're/NN talking/VB prehistoric/DT electronic/JJ bumblebee/NN noise./RP Stuff/NN they/PRP might/MD have/VB

speak/VB and/CC function/NN as/IN normal.../NN er,/. I/PRP mean,/VB as/IN they/PRP did/VB before/RB becoming/VB zombified./IN This/DT gives/VB our/PRP$ auteur/JJ ample/JJ opportunities/NN to/TO shower/VB us/PRP with/IN more/JJ of/IN his/PRP$ golden/JJ dialog./RP Yes,/NN a/DT golden/JJ shower/. it/PRP is.<br/VB /><br/DT />I/NN won't/IN spoil/DT anything/NN by/IN revealing/VB the/DT shock/NN ending./IN All/DT I/PRP can/MD say/VB is/VB it's/VB perfectly/RB in/IN tune/NN with/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN this/DT masterpiece./NN The/DT spirit/NN of/IN Ed/NN Wood/NN lives/NN on.../. or/CC should/MD I/PRP say/VB his/PRP$ geist./NN
