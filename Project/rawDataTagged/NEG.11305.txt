When/WH you/PRP fashion/NN stories/NN so/RB that/IN their/PRP$ existence/NN hinges/VB solely/RB on/IN the/DT unexpectedness/NN of/IN the/DT ending,/NN you're/NN writing/VB jokes.<br/IN /><br/DT />Spoilers/NN below...<br/IN /><br/DT />The/NN movie/NN primarily/RB tries/VB to/TO tell/VB romantic/JJ stories./RP That's/NN fine./.
