Gandhi/NN My/PRP$ Father/NN is/VB a/DT well/RB made/VB movie./IN It/PRP nicely/RB portrays/VB the/DT life/NN of/RP Gandhiji's/NN Eldest/NN Son/NN Harilal./NN His/PRP$ character,/VB his/PRP$ differences/NN with/IN his/PRP$ father,/VB his/PRP$ love/NN for/IN his/PRP$ family,/VB his/PRP$ desire/NN to/TO stand/VB on/IN his/PRP$ own,/VB his/PRP$ failure,/VB his/PRP$ ego../FW Akshaye/NN Khanna/NN completely/RB justifies/VB the/DT role/NN of/RP Harilal./NN Just/RB not/RB him,/JJ everyone/NN did/VB well/RB in/IN the/DT roles/NN they/PRP played./RP Darshan/NN Jariwala/NN is/VB the/DT best/JJ on-screen/RP Gandhiji/NN I've/NN ever/RB seen./.
