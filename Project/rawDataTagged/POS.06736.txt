What's/NN more,/NN Victoria/NN was/VB forced/VB to/TO sleep/VB in/IN her/PRP$ mother's/NN bedroom/IN everyday/JJ until/IN she/PRP became/VB Queen.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT film/NN explains/VB that/DT

and/CC the/DT Queen/NN must/MD commission/NN Sir/NN Robert/NN Peel,/NN of/IN the/DT more/JJ conservative/JJ Tory/NN party,/NN as/IN the/DT new/JJ Prime/JJ Minister./NN The/DT film/NN chronicles/VB

who/WH was/VB accused/VB of/IN having/VB an/DT affair/NN with/IN John/NN Conroy/NN and/CC becoming/VB pregnant/JJ by/IN him./NN Because/IN of/IN her/PRP hatred/VB for/RP Conroy,/NN Victoria/NN

deals/NN with/IN --/. of/IN course/NN --/. the/DT romance/NN between/IN the/DT Queen/NN and/CC Prince/NN Albert./NN Victoria/NN kept/VB Albert/NN waiting,/NN as/IN the/DT film/NN makes/VB clear,/NN

find/VB a/DT good/JJ number/NN of/IN parallels/NN between/IN Prince/NN Albert/NN and/CC Prince/NN Philip,/NN the/DT current/JJ Queen's/NN husband./NN While/IN Philip/NN is/VB mainly/RB Danish,/NN

where/WH Albert/NN infuriates/NN Victoria/NN with/IN what/WH she/PRP perceives/VB as/IN his/PRP$ 'interference'/NN in/IN her/PRP$ affairs./NN Albert/NN doesn't/NN want/VB a/DT second/JJ 'Bedchamber/RP
