I/PRP ran/VB across/IN this/DT several/JJ years/NN ago/RB while/IN channel/NN surfing/NN on/IN a/DT Sunday/NN afternoon./NN Though/IN it/PRP was/VB obviously/RB a/DT cheesy/NN TV/NN movie/NN from/IN

/><br/IN />I/DT don't/NN wholly/RB understand/VB the/DT phenomenon,/NN but/CC somehow/RB the/DT 70s/NN seem/VB to/TO have/VB a/DT lock/NN on/IN horror/NN movies/NN that/WH are/VB actually/RB scary./VB The/DT decades/NN prior/RB to/TO the/DT 70s/NN produced/VB some/DT beautifully/NN shot/NN films/NN and/CC the/DT bulk/NN of/IN our/PRP$ enduring/JJ horror/NN icons,/. but/CC are/VB they/PRP actually/RB scary?/RP No,/NN not/RB very./VB Likewise/RB in/IN the/DT years/NN since/IN the/DT 70s/NN we've/NN gotten/VB horror/NN movies/NN that/WH are/VB cooler,/DT more/JJ exciting,/NN have/VB
