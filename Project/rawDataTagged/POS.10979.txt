The/DT author/NN of/RB "Nekromantik",/RP Jörg/NN Buttgereit's/NN second/JJ feature/NN film,/VB "Der/RP Todesking"/NN is/VB a/DT powerful/JJ masterpiece./RP Centered/NN around/IN a/DT chain/NN letter/NN originating/VB from/IN a/DT group/NN called/VB "The/DT Brotherhood/NN of/IN the/DT 7th/RP Day",/NN the/DT movie/NN shows/VB 7/CD episodes,/IN each/DT consisting/VB of/IN one/CD day/NN during/IN one/CD week,/. where/WH suicide/NN is/VB approached/VB using/VB different/JJ characters/NN and/CC situations/NN all/PDT the/DT while/IN the/DT letter/NN is/VB making/VB it's/DT rounds./NN Do/VB not/RB touch/VB this/DT one/CD if/IN you/PRP like/VB Hollywood/NN movies/NN or/CC musicals,/NN enjoy/VB happy/JJ or/CC even/RB remotely/RB "normal"/JJ movies/NN or/CC expect/VB a/DT movie/NN to/TO be/VB good/JJ only,/NN if/IN it/PRP is/VB focused/VB on/IN stage/NN acting.<br/IN /><br/DT />The/NN nihilistic,/NN avant-garde/NN approach/VB of/RP Der/NN Todesking/NN well/RB explains,/. why/WH Buttgereit's/NN movies/NN in/IN general/NN were/VB banned/VB in/RP Germany,/NN their/PRP$ native/JJ country/NN of/IN origin,/NN during/IN the/DT 80's/NN and/CC most/RB of/IN the/DT 90's./RP Der/NN Todesking/NN is/VB not/RB really/RB focused/VB on/IN the/DT characters/NN appearing/VB on-screen,/NN but/CC the/DT meaningless/JJ apathy/NN or/CC depression/NN most/RB people's/JJ lives/NN consist/VB of/IN in/RB general./RP Buttgereit/NN does/VB not/RB find/VB reasons/NN to/TO go/VB on/IN living,/DT only/JJ reasons/NN to/TO stop,/NN and/CC in/IN choosing/NN how/WH and/CC when/WH you/PRP die,/VB you/PRP can/MD also/RB be/VB the/DT king/NN of/RB death,/RP Der/NN Todesking.<br/NN /><br/IN />Buttgereit's/DT movies/NN are/VB generally/RB difficult/JJ to/TO categorize/NN and/CC Der/NN Todesking/NN is/VB no/DT exception./RP Featuring/NN the/DT same/JJ crew/NN and/CC almost/RB the/DT same/JJ cast/NN as/IN all/DT other/JJ of/IN his/PRP$ movies,/NN "art/. film"/PRP would/MD probably/RB be/VB the/DT closest/JJ description/NN every/DT time./RP Der/NN Todesking/NN features/VB an/DT original/JJ method/NN to/TO shoot,/VB create/VB the/DT mood/NN and/CC handle/VB the/DT central/JJ object/NN in/IN almost/RB every/DT scene./NN During/IN one/CD scene,/IN the/DT camera/NN slowly,/VB continuously/RB pans/VB in/IN 360/CD degree/NN circle,/NN while/IN a/DT person/NN lives/NN in/IN a/DT small/JJ one-room/NN apartment/NN for/IN a/DT day./NN During/IN another,/TO Buttgereit/NN uses/VB sound/NN and/CC film/NN corruption/NN to/TO depict/VB the/DT collapsing/VB mental/JJ state/NN of/IN a/DT man,/NN while/IN he/PRP dwells/VB in/IN his/PRP$ desperation./NN During/IN a/DT third,/NN seemingly/RB pleasant/JJ scene/NN names,/NN ages/NN and/CC occupations/NN of/IN actual/JJ people/NN to/TO have/VB committed/JJ suicide/NN are/VB shown/VB on-screen,/VB supposedly/RB warranting/VB the/DT ban/NN in/IN Germany/NN for/IN this/DT particular/JJ movie.<br/NN /><br/IN />Episode/DT movies/NN (and/VB especially/RB this/DT one,/NN as/IN the/DT scenes/NN are/VB only/RB vaguely/VB connected)/VB generally/RB suffer/VB from/IN incoherence,/NN and/CC Der/NN Todesking/NN is/VB no/DT exception./NN While/IN all/DT episodes/NN have/VB the/DT same/JJ focus/NN of/IN inflicted/VB death/NN and/CC it's/NN consequences/NN or/CC subsequences/NN in/IN all/DT it's/NN variations,/. there/EX are/VB very/RB powerful/JJ episodes,/NN yet/RB an/DT episode/NN or/CC two/CD might/MD even/RB seem/VB like/IN filler/DT material,/NN partly/RB draining/VB the/DT overall/JJ power/NN of/IN the/DT movie/NN -/. still,/IN the/DT the/DT jaw-dropping,/NN immensely/RB powerful/JJ intermissions/NN depicting/IN a/DT decomposing/NN body/NN manage/VB to/TO keep/VB the/DT movie/NN together/RB and/CC cleanse/VB it/PRP from/IN it's/DT more/JJ vague/JJ moments/NN back/RB to/TO the/DT status/NN of/IN greatness./IN The/DT general/JJ atmosphere/NN is/VB baffling,/TO awe-inspiring,/VB highly/RB depressing/JJ and/CC sometimes/RB even/RB disgusting/VB -/. so/RB much/RB so/RB that/IN dozens/NN of/IN people/NN left/VB in/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN the/DT movie/NN during/IN a/DT theater/NN showing/VB in/IN a/DT film/NN festival/NN I/PRP took/VB part/NN of.<br/IN /><br/DT />This/NN is/VB one/CD movie/NN that/WH does/VB leave/VB a/DT lasting/JJ impression/NN and/CC I/PRP strongly/RB recommend/VB it/PRP for/IN anyone/NN looking/VB for/IN a/DT special/JJ experience/NN and/CC something/NN they/PRP will/MD definitely/RB remember/VB in/IN years/NN to/TO come./VB Not/RB recommended/VB for/IN the/DT faint/JJ of/IN heart/NN or/CC show/NN time/NN fans,/IN this/DT is/VB a/DT small,/JJ different/JJ movie/NN that/IN truly/RB raises/VB feelings/NN in/IN the/DT audience./NN Whether/IN it/PRP be/VB confusion,/DT amazement/NN or/CC even/RB hate,/VB you/PRP aren't/VB likely/JJ to/TO be/VB left/VB cold/JJ by/IN this,/NN in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN the/DT best,/NN achievement/NN of/IN this/DT small/JJ indie/NN crew.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT main/JJ theme/NN of/IN the/DT movie,/VB "Die/RP Fahrt/NN ins/NN Reich/NN der/RP Menschentrümmer/NN part/VB I-III"/NN was/VB released/VB in/IN a/DT limited/VB 666-piece/CD 8"/NN vinyl/NN edition,/. which/WH is/VB now/RB much/RB sought/VB after./IN You/PRP still/RB can/MD get/VB the/DT classical/JJ masterpiece/NN by/IN getting/VB "The/RP Nekromantik"/NN soundtrack/NN CD,/NN which/WH I/PRP highly/RB recommend./VB The/DT Lo-Fi/NN synthesizer/NN music/NN in/IN the/DT movie/NN is/VB dark/JJ and/CC quirky,/VB almost/RB illbient-like,/VB makes/VB an/DT essential/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT movie's/NN atmosphere,/. and/CC is/VB something/NN you/PRP would/MD very,/VB very/RB rarely/RB hear/VB otherwise./DT Much/JJ recommended!/NN
