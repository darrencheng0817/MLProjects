The/VB Marriage/NN of/IN Maria/NN Braun/NN (MMB)/NN is/VB about/IN a/DT German/JJ girl/NN (Maria)/NN getting/VB married/VB to/TO a/DT German/JJ soldier/NN (Herman/RP Braun)/NN just/RB at/IN the/DT ending/VB of/IN the/DT war./NN After/IN being/VB married/VB for/IN half/PDT a/DT day/NN and/CC a/DT night,/NN Herman/NN is/VB send/VB to/TO the/DT front/JJ again./NN To/TO make/VB ends/VB meet,/DT Maria/NN starts/VB working/VB at/IN a/DT bar/NN for/IN mainly/RB American/JJ soldiers/NN and/CC get/VB to/TO know/VB a/DT black/JJ soldier./. She/PRP got/VB word/NN that/IN Herman/NN died/VB at/IN the/DT front,/NN and/CC things/NN develop/VB between/IN her/PRP and/CC the/DT American/JJ soldier./NN Herman/NN walks/VB in/IN on/IN them,/NN in/IN bed,/NN and/CC after/IN a/DT confrontation/NN between/IN him/PRP and/CC the/DT American,/NN Maria/NN killed/VB the/DT American./NN Herman/NN admits/VB to/TO the/DT murder,/NN ends/VB up/RP in/IN jail/NN and/CC Maria/NN vows/VB to/TO wait/VB for/IN him./IN The/DT country/NN is/VB in/IN shambles;/$ one/CD sees/VB people/NN leaving/VB everything/NN that/IN they/PRP are/VB busy/JJ with/IN for/IN a/DT cigarette./NN There/EX are/VB food/NN shortages./. It/PRP is/VB in/IN short,/IN a/DT time/NN of/IN survival/NN of/IN the/DT fittest./NN <br/NN /><br/NN />Basically/IN this/DT film/NN projects/NN Maria's/NN attitudes/NN -/. those/DT attitudes/NN she/PRP permits/VB herself/PRP under/IN the/DT mentioned/VB circumstances,/NN as/IN a/DT metaphor/NN for/RP Germany's/NN loss/NN of/IN soul/NN after/IN they/PRP lost/VB the/DT war,/NN and/CC how/WH it/PRP proceeds/VB to/TO rebuild/VB itself./NN For/IN example,/DT Maria/NN has/VB the/DT following/JJ conversation/NN with/IN a/DT peddler/NN (played/VB by/RP Fassbinder/NN himself);/IN the/DT peddler/NN tries/VB to/TO sell/VB her/PRP an/DT excellent/JJ copy/VB of/RP Kleist/NN and/CC she/PRP remarks/VB that/IN "Kleist/NN burns/VB out/RP to/TO quickly,/VB it/PRP does/VB not/RB provide/VB enough/JJ heat/NN for/IN the/DT cold"./NN The/DT peddler/NN answers/NN "That's/IN another/DT way/NN to/TO look/VB at/IN it./DT Right/NN now,/NN it's/VB probably/RB the/DT correct/JJ way"./NN <br/IN /><br/DT />Maria/NN meets/VB a/FW French/German/NN business/NN man,/RP Karl/NN Oswald/NN after/IN she/PRP bargains/NN her/PRP$ way/NN into/IN the/DT first/JJ class/NN train/NN compartment./. She/PRP decides/VB to/TO get/VB involve/VB with/RP Karl,/NN "You're/VB not/RB having/VB an/DT affair/NN with/RP me;/RP I'm/NN having/VB an/DT affair/NN with/IN you"./VB She/PRP also/RB takes/VB responsibility/NN in/IN the/DT company,/NN and/CC after/IN a/DT while/NN has/VB the/DT complete/JJ trust/NN of/IN the/DT firm./NN When/WH Karl/NN says/VB "I/DT suppose/NN we'll/VB just/RB have/VB to/TO wait/VB for/IN a/DT miracle"/NN she/PRP replies/VB "I/TO prefer/VB making/VB miracles/TO /VB then/RB wait/VB for/IN them"./NN In/IN her/PRP$ own/JJ words,/. she/PRP has/VB become/VB the/DT "Mata/RP Hari/NN of/IN the/DT economic/JJ miracle".<br/NN /><br/NN />In/IN a/DT lot/NN of/RP Fassbinder's/NN films/NN he/PRP tried/VB to/TO expose/VB the/DT psychological/JJ processes/NN which/WH lie/VB behind/IN social/JJ mechanisms/NN (see/RP Freud);/NN in/IN other/JJ words,/. he/PRP liked/VB pointing/VB his/PRP$ camera/NN at/IN the/DT bullsh*t,/NN the/DT false/JJ social/JJ mechanisms,/IN the/DT pretending./NN The/DT direct/JJ approach/NN Maria/NN takes/VB in/IN this/DT film/NN is/VB successful/JJ to/TO convey/VB this/DT ideology./NN For/IN example,/VB she/PRP phones/NN Karl/NN and/CC when/WH he/PRP picks/VB up/RP the/DT phone/NN her/PRP$ request/NN is/VB straight/RB to/TO the/DT point/NN "I/NN need/VB someone/NN to/TO sleep/VB with"./VB As/RB Fassbinder/NN said/VB "the/DT emotions/NN people/NN felt/VB did/VB not/RB exist/VB at/IN all/DT and/CC were/VB only/RB a/DT kind/NN of/IN sentimentality/NN which/WH we/PRP thought/VB we/PRP needed/VB to/TO be/VB properly/RB functioning/VB members/NN of/IN society"./VB He/PRP also/RB remarked/VB that/IN his/PRP$ films/NN are/VB anti/IN emotional./DT <br/NN /><br/NN />I/VB particularly/RB liked/VB the/DT scene/NN when/WH Karl/NN and/CC Maria/NN meet/VB in/IN the/DT Munich/NN restaurant/NN (apparently,/VB frequently/RB visited/VB by/RP Hitler/NN himself)./NN Maria/NN appears/VB in/IN control/NN and/CC Karl/NN a/DT bit/NN on/IN the/DT down/RB side,/VB as/RB if/IN Maria's/NN 'brutal/NN honesty'/NN wears/VB him/PRP out,/VB as/RB if/IN he/PRP is/VB not/RB completely/RB up/RB to/TO the/DT situation/NN anymore./RP Karl/NN says/VB "I/TO have/VB to/TO tell/VB myself/PRP over/RP and/CC over/IN that/WH I/PRP love/VB life"./DT Maria/NN replies/VB "That's/DT life/NN isn't/NN it./NN As/IN if/IN we/PRP signed/VB a/DT contract/NN to/TO enjoy/VB life./NN And/CC then/RB we/PRP go/VB out/RP to/TO eat/VB and/CC talk/VB about/RB food"./VB I/PRP guess/VB this/DT is/VB also/RB about/RP Fassbinder/NN attitudes/NN on/IN relationships,/NN to/TO never/RB submit/VB completely/RB to/TO anyone./NN And/CC why/WH would/MD you,/VB if/IN the/DT central/JJ matter/NN of/IN most/JJ of/IN his/PRP$ films/NN is/VB about/IN "What/DT love/NN becomes/VB in/IN this/DT society/NN /IN a/DT commodity,/NN an/DT instrument/NN of/IN power,/IN a/DT weapon."<br/NN /><br/NN />It/NN was/VB remarked/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VB typical/JJ Fassbinder/NN to/TO have/VB the/DT scenes/NN with/IN Maria/NN and/CC Betti/NN walking/VB in/IN expensive/JJ dresses/NN in/IN the/DT ruins/NN after/IN the/DT war/NN -/. with/IN these/DT clothing/NN essentially/RB the/DT wrong/JJ period./NN What/WH I/PRP think/VB he/PRP wanted/VB to/TO portray/VB here/RB were/VB those/DT attitudes,/NN when/WH you/PRP feel/VB bad,/IN that/DT "you/NN can/MD always/RB put/VB on/IN your/PRP$ make/VB up/RP and/CC face/VB the/DT day/NN looking/VB great"./RP But,/NN Fassbinder/NN was/VB not/RB interested/JJ in/IN perfection./IN Any/DT mistakes/NN made/VB in/IN a/DT film/NN could/MD just/RB be/VB corrected/VB in/IN the/DT next/JJ project./NN Since/IN he/PRP completed/VB films/NN (approximately/IN 4/CD a/DT year)/NN the/DT way/NN other/JJ people/NN rolled/VB cigarettes,/IN it/PRP is/VB not/RB peculiar/JJ that/IN this/DT film/NN has/VB some/DT very/RB bad/JJ scenes./NN Peter/NN Marthesheimer,/NN who/WH wrote/VB most/RB of/IN the/DT script,/NN mentioned/VB that/WH Fassbinder/NN likely/RB dreamed/VB up/RP the/DT whole/JJ scene/NN with/IN Maria/NN and/CC the/DT American/NN in/IN the/DT park,/NN overnight./NN <br/NN /><br/VB />Hanna/RP Schygulla/NN is/VB brilliant/JJ as/RB Maria./NN Mostly,/NN she/PRP just/RB stares/VB bluntly/RB into/IN the/DT camera./NN In/RB Maria's/NN own/JJ words/NN "It/NN is/VB a/DT bad/JJ time/NN for/RP emotions./RP But,/NN I/PRP like/VB it/PRP like/VB that"./IN <br/DT /><br/NN />There/NN are/VB different/JJ opinions/NN about/IN the/DT end./NN After/RB Karl/NN died/VB of/IN a/DT hart/NN attack,/NN Herman/NN finally/RB shows/VB up./DT (Herman/NN left/VB for/IN Australia/NN after/IN he/PRP got/VB out/RP of/IN prison,/NN to/TO "become/VB human/JJ again".)/NN After/IN the/DT testament/NN is/VB
