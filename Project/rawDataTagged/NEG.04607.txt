I/PRP admit/VB the/DT problem/NN I/PRP have/VB with/IN the/DT much-celebrated/RP Ealing/NN films/NN I've/NN seen/VB so/RB far/RB could/MD be/VB mine./VB To/TO my/PRP$ taste,/NN either/CC they/PRP

I/PRP wanted/VB to/TO like/VB "The/DT Man/NN In/IN The/DT White/JJ Suit"/NN but/CC found/VB myself/PRP struggling/VB to/TO sit/VB through/IN its/PRP$ short/JJ run/NN time.<br/IN /><br/DT />Textile/NN worker/NN Sidney/NN Stratton/NN (Alec/RP Guinness)/NN may/MD be/VB meek/NN in/IN manner,/NN but/CC he/PRP is/VB doggedly/TO committed/VB to/TO progress/VB in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN his/PRP$

Ernest/NN Thesinger/NN of/IN "Bride/NN Of/IN Frankenstein"/NN fame/NN plays/VB a/DT singularly/JJ nasty/JJ captain/NN of/IN industry/NN who/WH looks/VB like/VB Nosferatu/NN and/CC makes/VB a/DT
