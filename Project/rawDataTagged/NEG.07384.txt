Around/IN the/DT late/JJ 1970's,/NN animator/NN Don/NN Bluth,/NN frustrated/VB with/IN the/DT output/NN his/PRP$ company,/NN Disney/NN was/VB churning,/TO defected/VB from/IN the/DT Mouse/NN House/NN

THE/DT LITTLE/NN MERMAID.<br/NN /><br/NN />Considering/NN that/IN the/DT movie/NN has/VB such/PDT a/DT friendly-sounding/NN title,/. one/PRP would/MD expect/VB ALL/NN DOGS/NN GO/NN TO/TO HEAVEN/NN to/TO be/VB pleasant/JJ family/NN fare./VB Instead/RB Bluth/NN provides/VB a/DT surprisingly/RB dark/JJ story/NN involving/VB gambling,/IN deceit,/DT crime,/NN mistreatment,/. and/CC murder./NN That/IN itself/PRP is/VB not/RB a/DT problem/NN for/IN an/DT animated/NN feature/NN per/IN say,/NN but/CC it/PRP does/VB call/VB into/IN question/NN over/IN whether/IN the/DT film/NN is/VB for/IN

a/DT movie/NN with/IN a/DT major/JJ identity/NN crisis.<br/IN /><br/DT />Set/NN in/IN a/DT dreary/JJ junkyard/NN of/IN New/JJ Orleans,/NN the/DT movie/NN starts/VB out/RP when/WH Charlie/NN B./NN

that/IN "all/DT dogs/NN go/VB to/TO heaven/VB because/IN unlike/IN people,/DT dogs/NN are/VB usually/RB loyal/JJ and/CC kind."/VB This/DT line/NN represents/VB the/DT confused/JJ nature/NN of/IN the/DT movie,/NN since/IN the/DT dogs/NN in/IN the/DT movie,/NN the/DT whippet/NN aside,/NN are/VB presented/VB as/IN anything/NN but.<br/IN /><br/DT />Upon/NN realizing/VB that/IN he's/NN been/VB

Itchy,/NN Charlie/NN "rescues"/RP Carface's/NN prize,/RP AnneMarie,/NN a/DT human/JJ girl/NN who/WH can/MD talk/VB to/TO animals/NN (in/NN order/NN to/TO predict/VB who/WH will/MD win/VB the/DT rat/NN

the/DT human/JJ girl/NN AnneMarie/NN and/CC a/DT flamboyant/JJ musical/JJ alligator/NN who/WH appears/VB about/IN three-quarters/NN through/IN (with/IN the/DT vocal/JJ pipes/NN of/IN Ken/NN Page),/NN none/NN of/IN the/DT other/JJ characters/NN emerge/VB as/IN likable,/NN nor/CC frankly,/NN are/VB even/RB worth/JJ caring/VB about./RP Unfortunately,/NN that/IN also/RB applies/VB to/TO Charlie;/NN in/IN trying/VB to/TO make/VB him/PRP an/DT anti-hero,/NN the/DT script/NN (composed/NN by/IN more/JJ than/IN ten/DT writers)/NN only/RB succeeds/VB in/IN rendering/VB the/DT character/NN TOO/NN unlovable./NN As/IN such,/IN the/DT audience/NN feels/VB no/RB empathy/VB for/RP Charlie,/NN and/CC worse,/VB his/PRP$ redemption/NN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT movie/NN does/VB not/RB come/VB across/RP as/IN convincing./DT (Further/NN damaging/VB to/TO the/DT character/NN is/VB the/DT disappointingly/RB uncharismatic/VB vocal/JJ performance/NN from/IN Burt/NN Reynolds.)/NN Besides/IN the/DT lack/NN of/IN an/DT endearing/JJ lead,/IN the/DT movie's/JJ other/JJ problem/NN is/VB in/IN the/DT structure/NN of/IN the/DT story./NN The/DT slowly-paced/NN plot/NN jumps/VB all/DT over/IN the/DT place/NN and/CC makes/VB a/DT habit/NN of/IN throwing/VB in/IN extra/JJ scenes/NN which/WH serve/VB no/DT purpose/NN but/CC to/TO pad/VB out/RP the/DT movie's/NN running/VB time./IN The/DT aforementioned/JJ musical/JJ alligator/NN (who/NN resides/NN in/IN a/DT danky/NN sewer/NN infested/NN with/IN native/JJ rats)/NN seems/VB to/TO have/VB been/VB thrown/VB in/IN from/IN nowhere,/NN as/IN does/VB a/DT scene/NN where/WH Charlie/NN tries/VB to/TO show/VB his/PRP$ generosity/NN to/TO AnneMarie/NN by/IN feeding/VB a/DT pack/NN of/IN pastel-colored/DT pups/NN pizza./IN The/DT whole/JJ

some/DT of/IN the/DT most/JJ imaginative/NN visuals/NN from/IN Bluth's/NN team/NN (by/NN 1980's/NN standards,/. that/WH is),/VB particularly/RB a/DT frightening/JJ scene/NN where/WH Charlie/NN has/VB
