An/DT offensively/NN over-the-top/NN action/NN adventure,FIRST/NN BLOOD/NN PART/NN II/NN seemed/VB to/TO catch/VB the/DT mood/NN of/IN the/DT US/NN at/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN it's/DT release/NN in/IN the/DT mid-80's,with/JJ right-wing/JJ Reaganism/NN and/CC virulent/NN anti-red/NN feelings/NN still/RB not/RB finished/VB yet,though/IN the/DT emergence/NN of/IN a/DT certain/JJ Mikhail/NN Gorbachev/NN in/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN the/DT 'Evil/RP Empire'/NN in/IN Moscow/NN would/MD soon/RB render/VB these/DT types/NN of/IN films/NN redundant;even/NN Reagan/NN himself/PRP eventually/RB admitted/VB this/DT truism.<br/NN /><br/NN />In/. that/WH sense,we/PRP can/MD be/VB most/RB grateful/JJ to/TO 'Gorby',not/VB for/IN his/PRP$ disarmament/NN treaties/NN with/IN the/DT US,nor/NN his/PRP$ policies/NN of/IN 'glasnost',or/NN even/RB his/PRP$ support/NN of/IN democracy/NN being/VB restored/VB to/TO the/DT Eastern/JJ European/JJ countries/NN in/IN the/DT former/JJ Soviet/JJ Union's/NN backyard.No,it's/IN the/DT final/JJ diminution/NN of/IN foolish,jingoistic,bloated/DT cold-war/NN adventures/NN like/IN this.The/NN first/RB RAMBO/NN film/NN was/VB hardly/RB perfect,though/VB at/IN least/JJ was/VB a/DT mildly/RB literate/. and/CC adequate/JJ action/NN thriller/NN with/IN a/DT not/RB too/RB bad/JJ storyline.In/IN this/DT sequel,any/NN sense/NN of/IN even/RB the/DT remotest/NN conviction/NN is/VB instantly/RB jettisoned/VB for/IN silly,senseless/NN plotting/VB and/CC incident/NN in/IN which/WH Rambo/NN single-handedly/NN takes/VB on/IN scores/NN of/IN brainlessly/DT stereotyped/NN Vietnamese/NN and/CC Russian/JJ troops/NN to/TO rescue/VB American/JJ POW's/NN ten/NN years/NN after/IN the/DT conflict/NN ended,with/IN the/DT Americans/NN on/IN the/DT losing/VB side.<br/DT /><br/NN />Perhaps/IN the/DT reason/NN why/WH the/DT film/NN was/VB a/DT huge/JJ box-office/NN success/NN was/VB to/TO let/VB many/JJ Americans/NN wallow/NN in/IN fantasy;they/NN may/MD have/VB lost/VB the/DT war,but/NN there/EX was/VB still/RB unfinished/JJ business/NN at/IN hand,and/DT ludicrous/JJ comic-strip/NN heroics/NN with/IN a/DT robot-like/NN hero/NN killing/VB virtually/RB every/DT red/JJ on/IN sight,with/NN as/IN much/JJ hardware/NN as/IN possible,fulfilled/DT such/JJ whimsically/NN far-fetched/IN ideals.<br/DT /><br/NN />This/NN could/MD have/VB been/VB entertaining/JJ on/IN a/FW SUPERMAN/SPIDERMAN/NN level,but/VB sadly/RB everything/NN is/VB played/VB absolutely/RB straight.But/. that/WH is/VB not/RB to/TO say/VB that/IN there/EX is/VB no/DT humour/NN in/IN the/DT film;sadly/NN it/PRP is/VB virtually/RB all/RB of/IN the/DT unintentional/NN kind.The/NN action/NN scenes,though/VB technically/RB adequate,never/VB once/RB carry/VB the/DT slightest/JJ bit/NN of/IN conviction/NN or/CC persuasiveness,because/VB they/PRP are/VB always/RB placed/VB in/IN the/DT most/RB spectacularly/RB unbelievable/VB of/IN contexts;namely,our/DT hero/NN Rambo/NN is/VB always/RB unscathed/JJ (aside/NN from/IN a/DT few/JJ cuts/NN and/CC bruises/VB here/RB and/CC there)/NN despite/IN the/DT tons/NN of/IN explosives,grenades,gunshots,etc.going/NN around/IN him.<br/DT /><br/NN />In/NN between/IN the/DT mayhem,what/NN there/EX is/VB of/IN a/DT script/NN consists/VB of/IN the/DT dullest/JJ clich√©s/NN and/CC banalities.Stallone,who/NN co-wrote/IN the/DT script/NN with/IN James/NN Cameron/NN (a/IN long/JJ way/NN from/IN the/DT exciting/JJ TERMINATOR/NN made/VB the/DT previous/JJ year),deliberately/NN seems/VB to/TO have/VB given/VB the/DT Rambo/NN character/NN as/IN little/JJ to/TO say/VB in/IN understandable/JJ English,and/NN merely/RB comes/VB out/RP with/IN moronic/DT grunts,almost/NN as/IN though/IN he/PRP has/VB invented/VB his/PRP$ own/JJ brand/NN of/IN patois/NN only/RB understandable/JJ to/TO himself.Maybe/VB his/PRP$ colleague/NN Cameron/NN was/VB thinking/VB of/IN The/DT Terminator/NN again/RB with/IN so/RB little/JJ communication/NN involved/VB for/IN the/DT lead/JJ character!/NN In/IN this/DT sense/NN Rambo/NN seems/VB even/RB less/RB of/IN a/DT human/JJ than/IN the/DT Terminator/NN did!/IN The/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT cast/NN do/VB little/RB better/RB with/IN good/JJ actors/NN like/IN Charles/NN Napier/NN and/CC Richard/NN Crenna/NN doing/VB their/PRP$ admirable/JJ best/JJ with/IN the/DT hackneyed/NN dialogue/NN they/PRP are/VB given,and/DT Steven/NN Berkoff/NN hamming/VB it/PRP up/RB outrageously/VB yet/RB again/RB with/IN another/DT of/IN his/PRP$ Russian/JJ KGB/Red/NN Army/NN villain/IN roles.Berkoff's/DT overplaying/NN is/VB mildly/RB enjoyable/JJ but/CC not/RB remotely/RB menacing.How/VB come/VB that/WH Sly/NN managed/VB to/TO survive/VB Berkoff's/NN electric/JJ shock/NN torture/VB to/TO kill/VB yet/RB more/RB of/IN those/DT Red/JJ Commie/NN scumbags?/RP Well,credibility/NN is/VB never/RB this/DT film's/JJ strong/JJ point.It/NN is/VB a/DT work/NN of/IN fantasy/NN comparable/JJ with/IN THE/DT WIZARD/NN OF/IN OZ.At/NN least/JJ that/WH WAS/NN meant/VB to/TO be/VB a/DT fantasy,and/NN an/DT immortal/JJ classic/JJ it/PRP turned/VB out/RP to/TO be.This/VB is/VB only/RB a/DT classic/JJ of/IN the/DT most/JJ dismal,and/NN indeed/RB offensive,kind.And/VB as/RB for/RP Sly's/NN climactic/IN speech...,rather/DT hypocritical/NN after/IN slaughtering/IN all/PDT those/DT people,eh?/NN By/IN the/DT way,in/NN the/DT same/JJ year,he/NN also/RB made/VB ROCKY/NN IV..........<br/NN /><br/NN />RATING:3/VB out/RP of/RP 10./CD
