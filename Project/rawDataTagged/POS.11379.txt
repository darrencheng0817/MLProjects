The/DT movie/NN is/VB about/IN Anton/NN Newcombe./NN The/DT music/NN and/CC careers/NN of/IN the/DT two/CD bands/NN are/VB simply/RB backdrop./RP It's/NN only/RB fair/JJ that/WH Newcombe/NN have/VB

BJM/NN lineup/NN great,/NN with/IN the/DT sole/JJ exception/NN of/IN a/DT single/JJ montage,/NN lasting/VB a/DT minute/NN or/CC so,/NN showing/VB Newcombe/NN creating/recording/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN

to/TO have/VB been/VB in/RP Newcombe's/NN mind/NN and/CC soul/NN before/IN they/PRP could/MD enter/VB the/DT world.<br/NN /><br/IN />Three/DT commentaries/NN accompany/VB the/DT film;/$ one/CD by/IN the/DT filmmakers,/NN and/CC two/CD by/IN the/DT members/NN of/IN the/DT bands/NN (the/RP BJM/NN track/NN is/VB solely/RB former/JJ members,/NN and/CC without/IN Newcombe)./NN Both/CC the/DT Warhols/NN and/CC BJM/NN alumni/NN point/VB up/RP this/DT montage/NN sequence/NN as/IN the/DT "best"/NN bit/NN in/IN the/DT film,/NN and/CC I'd/NN agree/VB that,/TO given/VB the/DT film's/NN focus/VB on/IN Anton/NN Newcombe,/NN it/PRP is/VB the/DT only/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT film/NN that/IN sheds/DT proper/JJ light/NN on/IN his/PRP$ gift,/NN and/CC seems/VB too/RB brief/JJ to/TO lend/VB proper/JJ

of/IN high/JJ school/NN life/NN for/IN its/PRP$ denizens/NN --/. as/IN I/PRP believe/VB it/PRP does/VB --/. the/DT Dandies/NN are/VB the/DT popularity-obsessed/NN preppy/NN types,/IN the/DT ones/NN

Newcombe's/NN meltdown/NN (all/IN the/DT BJM/NN footage/NN here/RB ends/VB at/RP 1997,/CD before/RB Newcombe/NN quit/VB heroin)./RP Courtney/NN Taylor-Taylor's/NN discounting/VB of/RP Newcombe's/NN
