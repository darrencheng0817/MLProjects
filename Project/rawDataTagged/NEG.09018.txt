There/EX is/VB a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT spoiler/NN below,/. which/WH could/MD ruin/VB the/DT surprise/NN of/IN the/DT ONE/NN unexpected/JJ and/CC truly/RB funny/JJ scene/NN in/IN this/DT film./NN There/EX is/VB also/RB information/NN about/IN the/DT first/JJ film/NN in/IN this/DT series.<br/NN /><br/NN />I/NN caught/VB this/DT film/NN on/RP DVD,/NN which/WH someone/NN gave/VB as/IN a/DT gift/NN to/TO my/PRP$ roommate./NN It/PRP came/VB as/IN a/DT set/VB together/RB with/IN the/DT first/JJ film/NN in/IN the/DT "Blind/RP Dead"/NN series.<br/IN /><br/DT />This/NN movie/NN was/VB certainly/RB much/RB worse/JJ than/IN the/DT first,/VB "La/RP Noche/NN del/DT Terror/NN Ciego"./NN In/IN addition,/DT many/JJ of/IN the/DT features/NN of/IN the/DT first/JJ movie/NN were/VB changed/VB significantly./VB To/TO boot,/VB the/DT movie/NN was/VB dubbed/VB in/IN English/NN (the/VB first/RB was/VB subtitled),/. which/WH I/PRP tend/VB to/TO find/VB distracting.<br/IN /><br/DT />The/NN concept/NN behind/IN the/DT series/NN is/VB that/IN in/IN the/DT distant/JJ past/IN a/DT local/JJ branch/NN of/IN the/DT Knights/NN Templar/NN was/VB involved/VB in/IN heinous/NN and/CC secret/JJ rituals./NN Upon/IN discovery/NN of/IN these/DT crimes,/NN the/DT local/JJ peasantry/NN put/VB the/DT Templars/NN to/TO death/NN in/IN such/PDT a/DT manner/NN that/IN their/PRP$ eyes/NN can/MD no/RB longer/RB be/VB used,/VB thus/RB preventing/VB them/PRP from/IN returning/VB from/IN Hell/NN to/TO exact/JJ their/PRP$ revenge./NN We/PRP then/RB jump/VB to/TO modern/JJ times/NN where/WH because/RB of/IN some/DT event,/NN the/DT Templars/NN arise/VB from/IN the/DT dead/JJ to/TO exact/JJ their/PRP$ revenge/NN upon/IN the/DT villagers/NN whose/WH$ ancestors/NN messed/. them/PRP up/RP in/IN the/DT first/JJ place./NN Of/IN course,/NN since/IN the/DT undead/NN knights/NN have/VB no/RB eyes,/VB they/PRP can/MD only/RB find/VB their/PRP$ victims/NN when/WH they/PRP make/VB some/DT sort/NN of/IN noise.<br/NN /><br/VB />The/RP Templars/NN were/VB a/DT secretive/JJ order,/NN from/IN about/IN the/DT 12th/JJ century,/NN coming/VB out/RP of/IN the/DT Crusades./NN They/PRP were/VB only/RB around/RB for/IN about/IN 150/CD years,/NN before/IN they/PRP were/VB suppressed/VB in/IN the/DT early/JJ 1300s/NN by/IN the/DT Pope/NN and/CC others./NN Because/IN they/PRP were/VB secretive,/IN there/EX were/VB always/RB rumors/NN about/IN their/PRP$ ceremonies,/NN particularly/RB for/RB initiation./RP Also,/NN because/IN of/IN the/DT way/NN the/DT society/NN was/VB organized,/IN you/PRP didn't/VB necessarily/RB have/VB church/NN officials/NN overseeing/VB things,/. which/WH meant/VB they/PRP didn't/MD have/VB an/DT inside/JJ man/NN when/WH things/NN heated/VB up./RP And,/NN because/IN of/IN the/DT nature/NN of/IN their/PRP$ trials,/NN they/PRP were/VB tortured/NN into/IN confessions./IN The/DT order/NN was/VB strongest/JJ in/RP France,/NN but/CC did/VB exist/VB in/IN Portugal/NN and/CC Spain,/NN where/WH the/DT movies/NN take/VB place.<br/DT /><br/NN />Where/IN the/DT first/JJ movie/NN had/VB a/DT virgin/JJ sacrifice/NN and/CC knights/NN drinking/VB the/DT blood/NN directly/RB from/IN the/DT body/NN of/IN the/DT virgin/JJ (breast/NN shots/NN here,/NN of/IN course,/IN this/DT is/VB a/DT horror/NN film/NN after/IN all),/NN and/CC then,/NN once/IN the/DT knights/NN come/VB back/RP to/TO life,/VB they/PRP attack/VB their/PRP$ victims/NN by/IN eating/VB them/PRP alive/JJ and/CC sucking/VB their/PRP$ blood;/NN in/IN this/DT sequel,/NN this/DT all/RB disappears./VB You/PRP still/RB have/VB the/DT same/JJ scene/NN (redone,/VB not/RB the/DT same/JJ footage)/NN of/IN them/PRP sacrificing/VB the/DT virgin,/NN but/CC they/PRP drain/VB the/DT blood/NN into/IN a/DT bowl/NN and/CC drink/VB it/PRP from/IN that./TO Thus,/NN when/WH they/PRP come/VB back,/IN they/PRP just/RB hack/JJ people/NN up/RB with/IN their/PRP$ swords/NN or/CC claw/NN people/NN to/TO death,/VB which/WH I/PRP have/VB to/TO say/VB is/VB a/DT much/JJ less/JJ effective/JJ means/NN of/IN disturbing/JJ your/PRP$ audience./FW There's/NN also/RB a/DT time/NN problem:/NN in/IN the/DT first/JJ film/NN the/DT dating/VB is/VB much/RB closer/RB to/TO the/DT Templars,/NN where/WH here/RB they/PRP are/VB now/RB saying/VB it/PRP is/VB the/DT 500/CD anniversary/NN of/IN the/DT peasants/NN burning/VB these/DT guys/NN at/IN the/DT stake,/NN which/WH would/MD date/VB it/PRP around/RP 1473./CD And/CC the/DT way/NN that/IN the/DT Templars/NN lose/VB their/PRP$ eyes/NN is/VB much/RB less/RB interesting/JJ as/IN well./NN In/IN the/DT first,/NN they/PRP have/VB them/PRP pecked/VB out/RP by/IN crows./NN Now/RB they/PRP are/VB simply/RB burned/JJ out,/NN and/CC in/IN quite/RB a/DT ridiculous/JJ manner.<br/NN /><br/IN />Oh/DT yeah,/NN and/CC maybe/RB it/PRP was/VB just/RB me,/. but/CC there/EX seemed/VB to/TO be/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN people/NN from/IN the/DT first/JJ movie/NN reappearing/NN in/IN this/DT film/NN (despite/NN having/VB died)./VB Not/RB really/RB a/DT problem,/NN since/IN the/DT movie/NN is/VB completely/RB different/JJ and/CC not/RB a/DT sequel/NN in/IN the/DT sense/NN of/IN a/DT continuation,/NN but/CC odd/JJ none-the-less.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT highlight/NN of/IN this/DT movie/NN is/VB the/DT rich/JJ fellow/NN who/WH uses/VB a/DT child/NN to/TO distract/VB the/DT undead/NN while/IN he/PRP makes/VB a/DT break/NN for/IN the/DT jeep./NN The/DT child's/NN father/NN had/VB already/RB been/VB suckered/NN by/IN this/DT rich/JJ man/NN into/IN making/VB an/DT attempt/NN to/TO get/VB the/DT jeep,/NN so/IN he/PRP walks/VB out/RP and/CC tells/VB her/PRP to/TO find/VB her/PRP father./VB It/PRP comes/VB somewhat/RB out/RB of/IN the/DT blue,/NN and/CC is/VB easily/RB the/DT funniest/NN scene/NN in/IN the/DT film./NN Of/IN course,/NN why/WH the/DT child/NN doesn't/NN die/VB at/IN this/DT point/NN is/VB beyond/IN me,/NN and/CC disappointed/VB for/IN horror/NN fans.<br/IN /><br/DT />I/NN couldn't/VB possibly/RB recommend/VB this/DT film/NN to/TO anyone./VB It/PRP isn't/VB so/RB bad/JJ that/IN it/PRP becomes/VB funny,/VB so/RB it/PRP just/RB ends/VB up/RB being/VB a/DT mediocre/JJ horror/NN film./IN The/DT bulk/NN of/IN the/DT film/NN has/VB several/JJ people/NN holed/VB up/RP in/IN a/DT church,/NN each/DT making/VB various/JJ attempts/NN to/TO go/VB it/PRP alone/RB in/IN order/NN to/TO escape/VB the/DT blind/JJ dead/NN who/WH have/VB them/PRP surrounded./VB When/WH the/DT film/NN ends,/. you/PRP are/VB not/RB surprised/VB at/IN the/DT outcome/NN at/IN all;/NN in/IN fact,/NN quite/RB disappointed./VB If/IN you/PRP are/VB into/IN the/DT novelty/NN of/IN seeing/VB a/DT Spanish/JJ horror/NN film,/NN see/VB the/DT first/JJ movie,/NN which/WH at/IN least/JJ has/VB some/DT innovative/JJ ideas/NN and/CC not/RB so/RB expected/VB outcomes./DT
