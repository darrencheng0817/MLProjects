Watching/NN John/NN Cassavetes/NN film,/RP Opening/NN Night,/NN I/PRP was/VB reminded/VB of/IN something/NN that/IN Quentin/NN Tarantino/NN said/VB once/RB in/IN an/DT interview/NN about/IN personal/JJ experience/NN in/IN being/VB a/DT creator/NN of/IN art/NN or/CC acting./VB He/PRP referred/VB to/TO an/DT example/NN of,/NN say,/NN if/IN he/PRP ran/VB over/IN a/DT dog/NN while/IN on/IN his/PRP$ way/NN to/TO act/VB in/IN a/DT play/NN that/IN it/PRP wouldn't/MD be/VB the/DT end/NN of/IN his/PRP$ life/NN but/CC that/WH it/PRP would/MD affect/VB him,/NN and/CC that,/NN without/IN a/DT doubt,/NN he/PRP would/MD have/VB to/TO bring/VB that/IN experience/NN with/IN him/PRP on/IN stage/NN even/RB if/IN it/PRP was/VB a/DT light/JJ comedy./NN "Otherwise,"/NN as/IN he/PRP said,/VB "what/TO am/VB I/PRP doing?"/VB I/PRP couldn't/MD help/VB but/CC think/VB of/IN his/PRP$ words/NN when/WH watching/VB Gena/NN Rowland's/NN character,/NN Myrtle/NN Gordon,/NN who/WH for/IN almost/RB a/DT whole/JJ week/NN or/CC so/RB goes/VB through/IN a/DT very/RB similar/JJ scenario./.
