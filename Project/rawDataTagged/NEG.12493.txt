but/CC as/IN I/PRP said/VB it's/DT fun/NN at/IN times/NN if/IN not/RB exactly/RB gripping/VB or/CC well/RB written./VB The/DT character's/NN are/VB mostly/RB annoying/VB American/JJ teens,/NN there's/IN the/DT expected/JJ arguing,/NN there's/IN the/DT macho/NN hero,/IN the/DT strong/JJ female/NN &/CC the/DT coward/NN who/WH thinks/VB only/RB of/IN himself/PRP so/RB there's/VB no/DT

was/VB Raksha:/NN Curse/NN of/IN the/DT Snow/NN Demon/NN with/RP Raksha/NN meaning/NN demon/VB in/RP Tibetan/NN Sanskrit,/NN so/RB now/RB you/PRP know.<br/VB /><br/DT />This/NN has/VB reasonable/JJ
