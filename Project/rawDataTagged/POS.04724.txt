Michael/NN Curtiz/NN directed/VB this/DT 1930/CD very-stylish/NN whodunit/NN from/IN a/DT script/NN by/IN Robert/NN Presnell/NN Sr.,/NN Robert/NN N./NN Lee/NN and/CC Peter/NN Mine./NN The/DT

the/DT strange/JJ S.S./NN Van/NN Dine./NN Vance/NN was/VB a/DT long-worded/NN and/CC superior/JJ detective/NN genius,/. and/CC his/PRP$ character/NN being/VB assigned/VB to/TO William/NN Powell/NN probably/RB meant/VB the/DT executives/NN at/IN Warner/NN Brothers/NN were/VB aware/JJ of/IN the/DT possibility/NN that/IN in/IN less-engaging/DT hands/NN this/DT detective/NN might/MD alienate/VB

and/CC Paul/NN Lukas/NN before/IN being/VB consigned/VB to/TO "B"/VB picture/NN status.The/IN other/JJ question/NN as/IN always/RB with/IN Warner/NN Brothers/NN executives/NN is/VB why/WH they/PRP chose/VB Vance/NN as/IN a/DT character;/VB their/PRP$ penchant/NN was/VB to/TO choose/VB men/NN who/WH operated/VB outside/IN the/DT law,/NN with/IN no/DT apparent/JJ discrimination/NN between/IN a/DT
