Daniel/NN Day-Lewis/NN is/VB Christy/NN Brown,/NN a/DT victim/NN of/IN cerebral/DT palsy/NN who/WH uses/VB "My/TO Left/VB Foot"/NN to/TO write/VB and/CC paint/VB in/IN this/DT incredible/JJ 1989/CD

great/JJ script/NN and/CC wonderful/JJ direction/NN by/IN Jim/NN Sheridan/NN help/VB to/TO paint/VB a/DT vivid/JJ portrait/NN of/RP Christy/NN Brown,/NN an/DT artist/NN and/CC writer/NN who/WH died/VB in/IN 1981/CD at/IN the/DT age/NN of/IN 49.<br/DT /><br/NN />Brown/NN was/VB born/VB into/IN a/DT lower/JJ middle-class/NN Catholic/NN family/NN where/WH his/PRP$ mother/NN was/VB constantly/RB pregnant/JJ (22/NN children/NN in/IN total,/$ 13/CD of/IN whom/WH survived)./VB His/PRP$ father/NN considered/VB Christy/NN mentally/RB retarded/JJ as/IN well/RB as/RB physically/RB handicapped,/. but/CC he/PRP would/MD not/RB permit/VB his/PRP$ son/NN to/TO go/VB into/IN a/DT home./NN The/DT children/NN in/IN the/DT family/NN would/MD bid/VB goodbye/VB to/TO him/PRP each/DT day/NN as/IN they/PRP went/VB off/RP to/TO school,/NN and/CC then/RB his/PRP$ mother/NN would/MD feed/VB him/PRP and/CC talk/VB to/TO him.<br/VB /><br/NN />In/IN the/DT movie,/RP Fricker/NN conveys/IN the/DT sense/NN of/IN a/DT woman/NN who,/NN despite/IN being/VB surrounded/VB by/IN a/DT huge/JJ family,/NN needs/VB someone/NN to/TO talk/VB to./RP Christy/NN doesn't/NN talk/NN back./VB Eventually/RB a/DT

relaxed/NN way/NN the/DT in/IN which/WH the/DT other/JJ children/NN treat/VB him.<br/IN /><br/DT />There/NN are/VB many/JJ powerful/JJ scenes,/NN but/CC none/NN as/IN powerful/JJ as/RB Christy/NN writing/VB "Mother"/NN on/IN the/DT floor/NN holding/VB a/DT piece/NN of/IN chalk/NN between/IN his/PRP$ toes./NN "He's/IN a/DT true/JJ Brown,"/NN his/PRP$ father/NN declares,/NN hoisting/. him/PRP

and/CC characters/NN combined./NN Brown/NN wasn't/VB actually/RB diagnosed/VB with/IN cerebral/DT palsy/NN for/IN some/DT time,/NN which/WH was/VB left/VB out/RP of/IN the/DT movie./NN The/DT therapist/RP Eileen/NN is/VB actually/RB a/DT combination/NN of/IN three/CD important/JJ therapeutic/JJ figures/NN in/RP Christy's/NN life,/. and/CC though/IN we/PRP know/VB that/IN his/PRP$ mother/NN

all/DT of/RB that,/RP Christy/NN Brown's/NN biopic/NN is/VB incredibly/RB powerful,/VB all/PDT the/DT more/RB so/RB because/IN of/IN two/CD performances:/NN Hugh/NN O'Conor/NN as/IN young/JJ
