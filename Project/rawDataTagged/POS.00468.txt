Watch/NN On/IN The/VB Rhine/NN started/VB as/IN a/DT Broadway/NN play/VB by/RP Lillian/NN Hellman/NN who/WH wrote/VB the/DT film/NN and/CC saw/VB it/PRP open/VB on/IN Broadway/NN at/IN a/DT time/NN

pulled/VB an/DT award/NN hat/NN trick/VB in/IN 1943/CD winning/VB an/DT Oscar,/NN a/DT Golden/JJ Globe,/NN and/CC the/DT New/NN York/NN Film/NN Critics/NN for/IN Best/RB Actor./NN Probably/RB if/IN

Christians/NN did/VB not/RB repeat/VB her/PRP$ Broadway/NN part/NN and/CC the/DT role/NN of/RP Lukas's/NN wife/NN was/VB given/VB to/TO Bette/NN Davis./NN Davis/NN took/VB the/DT part/NN not/RB
