There/EX aren't/VB many/JJ overcoming-the-odds/NN stories/NN quite/RB like/IN that/DT of/RP Christy/NN Brown./NN Born/VB with/IN cerebral/DT palsy/NN in/IN 1930s/CD Dublin,/NN his/PRP$ parents/NN thought/VB his/PRP$ handicap/NN was/VB mental/JJ as/IN well/RB as/IN physical./NN Though/IN eventually/RB properly/RB diagnosed,/RP Brown,/NN in/IN a/DT lower/JJ working-class/JJ family/NN with/IN nearly/RB 20/CD children,/NN had/VB to/TO push/VB himself/PRP just/RB to/TO be/VB appreciated/VB by/IN his/PRP$ family./NN Through/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN his/PRP$ only/JJ fully-functioning/NN limb,/IN his/PRP$ left/VB leg,/IN he/PRP taught/VB himself/PRP to/TO write/VB and/CC paint,/VB both/DT skills/NN he/PRP developed/VB expertly./IN <br/DT /><br/NN />But/. what/WH makes/VB the/DT film/NN version/NN of/RP Brown's/NN autobiography/NN "My/NN Left/VB Foot"/NN such/PDT a/DT great/JJ retelling/NN is/VB its/PRP$ humility./NN Both/DT director/writer/NN Jim/NN Sheridan/NN and/CC star/NN Daniel/NN Day-Lewis/NN have/VB managed/VB to/TO tell/VB this/DT story/NN in/IN a/DT way/NN that/IN doesn't/NN scream/VB for/IN attention/NN and/CC resort/NN to/TO melodrama./PRP$ Cheesy/NN struggles/NN and/CC scenes/NN of/IN frustration/NN as/IN well/RB as/IN glorious/JJ moments/NN of/IN minute/JJ victory/NN are/VB easy/JJ pitfalls/NN of/IN a/DT story/NN so/RB miraculous,/VB yet/RB "My/VB Left/VB Foot"/NN stays/VB real/JJ and/CC intrinsically/NN inspired.<br/IN /><br/DT />Day-Lewis/NN is/VB the/DT easiest/JJ to/TO highlight./VB Playing/VB anyone/NN with/IN such/JJ serious/JJ physical/JJ impairments/NN has/VB to/TO be/VB a/DT demanding/VB task./VB Not/RB only/RB does/VB Day-Lewis/NN give/VB us/PRP a/DT very/RB complete/VB picture/VB of/RP Christy,/NN but/CC he/PRP also/RB manages/VB to/TO chronicle/NN the/DT growth,/NN improvement/NN and/CC inner/JJ change/NN of/IN the/DT character/NN in/IN different/JJ stages/NN of/IN his/PRP$ life./NN He/PRP plays/VB Christy/NN at/IN 17/CD when/WH he/PRP had/VB limited/JJ language/NN capability/NN and/CC was/VB emotionally/RB volatile/JJ just/RB as/IN crisply/NN as/IN he/PRP does/VB the/DT intellectually/RB learned/VB Christy/NN who/WH struggles/VB to/TO cope/VB with/IN why/WH he/PRP can't/MD find/VB non-platonic/NN love./IN The/DT latter/JJ theme/NN is/VB the/DT film's/JJ strongest/JJ and/CC it/PRP would've/MD been/VB nice/JJ for/IN Sheridan/NN and/CC co-adapter/RP Shane/NN Connaughton/NN to/TO really/RB flesh/NN that/VB out./RP Regardless,/NN Day-Lewis/NN gets/VB us/PRP to/TO understand/VB and/CC sympathize/NN

film./NN This/DT story/NN is/VB about/IN day-to-day/JJ life/NN and/CC struggles./NN Although/IN Christy/NN has/VB such/PDT a/DT unique/JJ set/NN of/IN circumstances/NN hampering/VB his/PRP$ life,/VB his/PRP$ struggles/NN are/VB not/RB unlike/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ and/CC Sheridan/NN grasps/NN that/IN concept/NN completely./RP Christy/NN struggles/VB with/IN love,/DT parental/JJ attention,/NN

/><br/NN />Sheridan/NN gives/VB us/PRP moments/NN that/WH capture/VB the/DT spirit/NN of/IN the/DT large/JJ Brown/NN family/NN and/CC Christy's/NN unique/JJ place/NN in/IN it./IN The/DT drama/NN evolves/VB naturally/RB when/WH tensions/NN are/VB highest/JJ and/CC the/DT humor/NN comes/VB in/IN much/RB the/DT same/JJ way./IN The/DT dinner/NN scene/NN when/WH Christy/NN learns/NN that/IN his/PRP$ doctor/teacher/NN --/. the/DT woman/NN he/PRP loves/VB --/. is/VB going/VB to/TO marry/VB his/PRP$ brother/NN Peter/NN is/VB the/DT film's/JJ finest/JJ example/NN of/IN both/DT Day-Lewis/NN

there/RB with/IN his/PRP$ stunning/JJ work.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT other/JJ strong/JJ component/NN of/IN the/DT film/NN is/VB Brenda/NN Fricker/NN as/IN Mrs./NN Brown./NN I/PRP did/VB not/RB know/VB she'd/TO won/VB the/DT Oscar,/NN but/CC there/EX was/VB something/NN about/IN her/PRP$ performances/NN as/RB Christy's/NN loving/. and/CC wise/JJ mother/NN that/IN just/RB screamed/VB Oscar-worthy./NN
