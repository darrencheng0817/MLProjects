OK/UH OK,/NN it/PRP might/MD be/VB hard/JJ to/TO put/VB the/DT entirety/NN of/IN a/DT man's/NN life/NN in/IN one/CD film./NN Traditionally/RB therefore,/JJ biopics/NN focus/VB on/IN one/CD or/CC two/CD significant/JJ parts/NN in/IN the/DT subject's/VB life./RP Now,/NN Byron/NN was/VB a/DT "my/NN week/NN beats/VB your/PRP$ year"/NN fellow,/. which/WH makes/VB selecting/VB parts/NN that/WH are/VB representative/NN even/RB harder./RP Furthermore,/NN just/RB as/RB Byron's/NN poetry/NN is/VB inseparable/NN from/IN his/PRP$ life,/NN the/DT man's/NN life/NN itself/PRP must/MD be/VB seen/VB as/IN a/DT whole./RP Lifting/NN parts/NN out/IN is/VB not/RB only/RB not/RB showing/VB the/DT whole/JJ picture,/NN it's/NN showing/VB a/DT different/JJ picture/NN altogether.<br/IN /><br/DT />Now,/NN in/IN short/JJ my/PRP$ review/NN comes/VB down/RP to/TO this:/VB supposedly,/DT Byron/NN was/VB indeed/RB the/DT "my/NN week/NN beats/VB your/PRP$ year"/NN prototype,/IN a/DT guy/NN who/WH lived/VB so/RB intensely/RB that/IN he/PRP indeed/RB did/VB more/RB in/IN his/PRP$ 15/CD or/CC so/RB active/JJ years/NN than/IN most/RB do/VB in/IN an/DT entire/JJ lifetime./RP True,/NN he/PRP had/VB setbacks/NN and/CC was/VB a/DT victim/NN of/IN the/DT time/NN and/CC social/JJ setting/VB he/PRP lived/VB in/IN -/. but/CC in/IN the/DT end,/NN this/DT dude/NN is/VB supposed/VB to/TO be/VB the/DT prototype/NN whose/WH$ life/NN we'd/IN all/DT want/VB to/TO lead,/VB no?/RP Well,/NN I/PRP did/VB NOT,/NN at/RP ANY/NN moment,/NN want/VB to/TO live/VB the/DT life/NN depicted/VB in/IN this/DT film./NN So/IN it/PRP gets/VB 3./CD Not/RB for/IN being/VB so/RB badly/RB done/VB (which,/TO direction-wise,/VB it/PRP more/RB or/CC less/JJ was),/NN but/CC more/RB importantly/RB for/IN missing/VB the/DT point/NN entirely/RB in/IN a/DT flat/JJ plot.<br/NN /><br/IN />Some/DT more/JJ detail./RP Well,/NN to/TO over/RB simplify/VB things,/IN a/DT Byron/NN bio/NN should/MD have/VB two/CD distinct/JJ episodes:/NN 1./CD Post-first/NN Europe/NN trip:/NN England/NN and/CC his/PRP$ rise/NN to/TO fame/NN +/NN marriage/NN //RP 2./CD His/PRP$ life/NN abroad./RP Now,/NN the/DT important/JJ thing/NN is/VB that/IN the/DT SECOND/NN part/NN should/MD be/VB at/IN least/JJ as/IN important/JJ as/IN the/DT first./NN Not/RB only/RB was/VB it/PRP a/DT lot/NN longer,/. but/CC the/DT most/JJ significant/JJ change/NN in/IN Byron/NN took/VB place/VB then./RP Furthermore,/NN it's/. where/WH he/PRP created/VB his/PRP$ best/JJ works/VB (Don/RP Juan,/NN the/DT Vision/NN of/RP Judgement/NN etc./NN -/. all/PDT the/DT stuff/NN that/WH makes/VB him/PRP *really*/VB unique/JJ in/IN English/NN literature).<br/IN /><br/DT />Instead,/NN in/IN this/DT film/NN (a)/RP Byron's/NN life/NN never/RB comes/VB across/RP as/IN even/RB remotely/RB entertaining,/VB (b)/IN it/PRP only/RB gets/VB *worse*/NN after/IN he/PRP leaves/VB England./NN They/PRP did/VB two/CD good/JJ jobs:/NN first,/. they/PRP started/VB at/IN his/PRP$ return/NN of/IN his/PRP$ Europe/NN trip/NN (though/IN a/DT bit/NN more/RB of/IN the/DT actual/JJ trip/NN would/MD have/VB been/VB welcome/VB as/IN a/DT prologue),/NN second,/. they/PRP chose/VB an/DT angle,/NN and/CC they/PRP chose/VB his/PRP$ incestuous/NN love/VB for/RP Augusta/NN (who/NN is/VB rather/RB perfectly/RB cast)./VB The/DT problem/NN with/IN this/DT last/JJ thing/NN is/VB that/IN they/PRP never/RB let/VB it/PRP go./RP True,/NN Byron/NN remained/VB strongly/RB attached/VB to/TO Augusta/NN for/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN his/PRP$ life,/NN but,/VB especially/RB as/IN he/PRP was/VB such/PDT a/DT mood/NN swing/NN person,/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN his/PRP$ letters/NN reflect/VB that/WH does/VB not/RB mean/VB that/IN at/IN other/JJ times/NN he/PRP might/MD not/RB have/VB completely/RB enjoyed/VB life.<br/DT /><br/NN />Anyway,/IN the/DT first/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT TV/NN film/NN should/MD have/VB ended/VB with/IN him/PRP leaving/VB England./NN There's/NN no/RB doubt/VB about/RB that./VB The/DT thing/NN is:/VB once/RB abroad,/VB a/DT life/NN of/IN debauchery/NN began/VB (with/IN the/DT infamous/NN Geneva/NN period),/. but/CC in/IN Italy/NN Byron/NN also/RB discovered/VB a/DT new/JJ life,/NN both/CC for/IN his/PRP$ poetry/NN (inspired/NN by/IN Italian/JJ comedy),/NN already/RB in/RP Venice,/NN and/CC for/IN himself/PRP when/WH he/PRP found/VB the/DT

We/PRP see/VB a/DT lonely,/JJ bored/JJ snob/NN getting/VB older.<br/IN /><br/DT />I/NN mean,/IN hell,/DT Byron/NN never/RB thought/VB much/RB about/IN his/PRP$ poetry,/NN except/IN when/WH he/PRP finally/RB found/VB his/PRP$ own/JJ voice/NN in/IN Don/NN Juan!/NN Apart/RB from/IN poetic/NN and/CC romantic/JJ developments,/IN his/PRP$ relationship/NN with/IN Shelly/NN (and/IN the/DT

True,/NN still/RB a/DT bit/NN naive,/. but/CC it's/NN what/WH got/VB him/PRP to/TO Greece!/NN And/CC the/DT whole/JJ thing/NN came/VB full/JJ circle/NN in/RP Pisa,/NN where/WH Shelley's/NN
