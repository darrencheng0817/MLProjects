segment/NN still/RB succeeds/VB in/IN maintaining/VB its/PRP$ air/NN of/IN mystery/NN through/IN a/DT particularly/RB harrowing/JJ dream/NN sequence/NN and/CC the/DT general/JJ ambiguity/NN of/IN the/DT story./RP Duffell's/NN direction/NN is/VB once/RB again/RB exceptional/JJ and/CC while/IN this/DT is/VB quite/RB possibly/RB the/DT weakest/JJ of/IN the/DT four/CD stories,/. there/EX is/VB no/RB denying/VB that/IN through/IN some/DT creative/JJ direction/NN and/CC credible/JJ acting/JJ Waxworks'/NN is/VB still/RB a/DT delightful/NN entry/NN into/IN the/DT film.<br/NN /><br/NN />Waxworks'/NN is/VB followed/VB by/IN what/WH is,/VB in/IN my/PRP$ opinion,/NN the/DT greatest/JJ of/IN the/DT four/CD segments/NN /NN Sweets/VB to/TO the/DT Sweet'./NN Christopher/NN Lee/NN stars/VB as/IN John/NN Reid,/NN the/DT father/NN to/TO a/DT young/JJ girl/NN who/WH to/TO begin/VB with/IN has/VB an/DT inexplicable/JJ fear/NN of/IN fire/NN which/WH is/VB soon/RB remedied/VB by/IN
