fact/NN it's/NN noted/VB by/IN several/JJ characters/NN throughout/IN the/DT serial.<br/NN /><br/NN />The/NN acting/VB is/VB wooden--/IN the/DT sets/NN are/VB cheap--/IN the/DT dialogue/NN is/VB

the/DT thugs/NN open/VB the/DT package/NN in/IN a/DT cardboard/NN warehouse--/. we/PRP know/VB it's/IN a/DT cardboard/NN warehouse/NN because/IN Batman/NN sneaks/NN in/IN and/CC pushes/VB these/DT
