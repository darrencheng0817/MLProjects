La/NN Chute/NN de/FW la/FW Maison/NN Usher,/NN or/CC The/DT Fall/NN of/IN the/DT House/NN of/RP Usher/NN as/IN it's/NN know/VB amongst/IN English/NN audiences,/NN starts/VB with/IN Allan/NN (Charles/RP Lamy)/NN heading/VB for/IN the/DT Castle/NN of/IN his/PRP$ good/JJ friend/NN Sir/NN Roderick/NN Usher/NN (Jean/RP Debucourt)/NN who/WH sent/VB him/PRP a/DT letter/NN saying/VB that/IN his/PRP$ wife/NN Madeleine/NN is/VB ill./VB Once/RB there/RB Allan/NN finds/VB Madeleine/NN very/RB sick/JJ &/CC her/PRP$ husband/NN Roderick/NN determined/VB &/CC almost/RB obsessed/VB to/TO paint/VB her/PRP$ portrait./NN As/IN Roderick/NN paints/NN Madeleine/NN becomes/VB weaker/JJ &/CC weaker/JJ almost/RB as/RB if/IN the/DT picture/NN is/VB draining/VB the/DT life/NN out/RP of/IN her,/DT Allan/NN tries/VB to/TO help/VB his/PRP$ friend/NN but/CC tragedy/NN soon/RB strikes...<br/VB /><br/IN />This/DT French/JJ production/NN was/VB co-written,/TO produced/VB &/CC directed/VB by/IN Jean/NN Epstein/NN &/CC was/VB the/DT second/JJ of/IN two/CD filmed/VB The/DT Fall/NN of/IN the/DT House/NN of/RP Usher/NN adaptations/NN during/IN 1928,/CD honestly/RB I/PRP don't/MD know/VB the/DT original/JJ novel/NN was/VB published/VB in/RP 1839,/CD I/PRP mean/VB you/PRP wait/VB 89/CD years/NN for/IN a/DT filmed/VB adaptation/NN &/CC two/CD come/VB along/RP at/IN the/DT same/JJ time!/RP Anyway,/NN I/PRP feel/VB that/IN I/PRP have/VB a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT problem/NN here/RB as/IN I/PRP have/VB read/VB plenty/RB of/IN positive/JJ comments/NN about/IN La/NN Chute/NN de/FW la/FW Maison/NN Usher/NN &/CC maybe/RB I'm/NN not/RB the/DT right/JJ sort/NN of/IN person/NN to/TO write/VB a/DT comment/NN on/IN it/PRP but/CC I/PRP have/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN it/PRP simply/RB didn't/VB do/VB anything/NN for/IN me./VB I/PRP didn't/VB like/IN it,/NN obviously/RB the/DT first/JJ thing/NN to/TO say/VB is/VB that/IN this/DT is/VB a/DT silent/JJ film/NN &/CC therefore/RB it/PRP relies/VB on/IN imagery/NN but/CC even/RB so/RB I/PRP thought/VB the/DT story/NN was/VB weak,/IN I/PRP thought/VB as/IN a/DT whole/JJ the/DT film/NN was/VB boring/JJ &/CC dull/JJ even/RB though/IN it/PRP only/RB lasts/VB for/IN about/IN an/DT hour/NN &/CC it/PRP really/RB didn't/VB do/VB anything/NN for/IN me/PRP at/IN all./DT La/NN Chute/NN de/FW la/FW Maison/NN Usher/NN was/VB made/VB almost/RB 80/CD years/NN ago/RB &/CC that/WH is/VB literally/RB a/DT lifetime,/NN the/DT world,/NN cinema/NN &/CC tastes/NN have/VB moved/VB on/IN a/DT lot/NN since/IN then/RB &/CC I/PRP found/VB no/DT enjoyment/NN in/IN this/DT film./NN I/PRP feel/VB this/DT film/NN has/VB dated/VB badly/RB &/CC probably/RB wasn't/VB that/IN good/JJ to/TO start/VB with/IN anyway./VB I/PRP never/RB felt/VB for/IN any/DT of/IN the/DT character's,/NN I/PRP never/RB cared/VB about/IN anything/NN that/WH was/VB happening/VB &/CC I/PRP found/VB it/PRP all/RB rather/RB tedious/VB to/TO sit/VB through,/RP I'm/NN sorry/JJ if/IN I've/NN offended/IN any/DT silent/JJ film/NN fans/NN out/IN there/RB but/CC that's/VB the/DT way/NN I/PRP felt.<br/MD /><br/VB />Director/RP Epstein/NN does/VB an/DT OK/JJ job,/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN people/NN ramble/NN on/IN about/IN the/DT imagery/NN in/IN La/NN Chute/NN de/FW la/FW Maison/NN Usher/NN &/CC I/PRP will/MD freely/RB admit/VB it/PRP definitely/RB has/VB it's/DT moments/NN but/CC I/PRP thought/VB they/PRP were/VB few/JJ &/CC far/RB between./RP Shots/NN of/IN people's/DT mouths/NN moving/VB &/CC not/RB actually/RB hearing/VB what/WH they/PRP say/VB just/RB seemed/VB weird/JJ to/TO me,/VB I/PRP didn't/VB like/IN the/DT music/NN &/CC the/DT version/NN I/PRP saw/VB kept/VB the/DT original/JJ French/JJ language/NN insert/NN cards/NN which/WH were/VB narrated/NN by/IN guy/NN with/IN the/DT most/JJ awful/JJ sounding/NN thick/JJ French/JJ accent/NN which/WH was/VB also/RB off/RB putting./VB Based/VB on/IN the/DT story/NN by/IN Edgar/NN Allen/NN Poe/NN I/PRP doubt/VB this/DT has/VB much/JJ resemblance/NN to/TO it/PRP apart/RB from/IN one/CD or/CC two/CD basic/JJ elements,/NN stick/VB with/IN the/DT fantastic/JJ Roger/NN Corman/NN House/NN of/RP Usher/NN starring/VB Vincent/NN Price.<br/NN /><br/NN />Technically/IN the/DT film/NN was/VB OK/UH considering/VB when/WH it/PRP was/VB made./IN You/PRP simply/RB cannot/VB tell/VB about/IN the/DT acting/NN as/IN no/DT one/NN ever/RB speaks/VB although/IN the/DT film/NN is/VB full/JJ of/IN unnatural/NN exaggerated/VB movements/NN to/TO try/VB &/CC suggest/VB emotions/NN or/CC reflect/VB what's/TO happening/VB which/WH works/VB to/TO an/DT extent/NN but/CC after/IN a/DT while/NN just/RB looks/VB a/DT bit/NN daft.<br/NN /><br/VB />La/RP Chute/NN de/FW la/FW Maison/NN Usher/NN will/MD appeal/VB to/TO those/DT who/WH crave/VB a/DT bygone/NN era,/. who/WH live/VB in/IN caves/NN or/CC who/WH are/VB stuck/VB in/IN the/DT past,/NN for/IN me/PRP I/PRP like/VB my/PRP$ films/NN to/TO have/VB a/DT story,/NN not/RB to/TO bore/VB me/PRP &/CC to/TO have/VB sound/NN &/CC I'm/NN sorry/JJ if/IN that/DT last/JJ statement/NN makes/VB me/PRP sound/VB like/IN an/DT uneducated/JJ idiot/NN but/CC that's/NN how/WH I/PRP feel./VB The/DT world/NN has/VB moved/VB on/IN since/RB 1928/CD &/CC for/IN the/DT better./NN
