With/IN the/DT release/NN of/IN Peter/NN Jackson's/NN famed/JJ "Lord/NN of/IN the/DT Rings"/NN trilogy,/. it/PRP is/VB even/RB easier/JJ to/TO dismiss/VB Ralph/NN Bakshi's/NN 1978/CD animated/NN Lord/NN of/IN the/DT Rings/NN film/NN as/IN inferior./VB I/PRP agree/VB with/IN the/DT majority/NN that/WH Jackson's/NN trilogy/NN is/VB the/DT essential/JJ film/NN adaptation/NN of/RP Tolkien's/NN work,/. but/CC that/WH does/VB not/RB prevent/VB me/PRP from/IN enjoying/VB Bakshi's/NN ambitious/JJ pioneering/JJ effort./NN Jackson/NN has/VB admitted/VB that/IN he/PRP received/VB at/IN least/JJ some/DT inspiration/NN from/IN seeing/VB Bakshi's/NN film/NN and/CC there/EX are/VB some/DT clear/JJ similarities/NN between/IN their/PRP$ adaptations.<br/NN /><br/NN />The/IN film's/DT colorful/JJ picturesque/NN backdrops/NN are/VB excellent/JJ and/CC the/DT score/NN is/VB memorable./IN I/PRP was/VB for/IN the/DT most/JJ part/NN satisfied/VB by/IN the/DT drawings/NN of/IN the/DT characters./NN The/DT pairs/VB of/RP Pippin/NN and/CC Merry/NN and/CC Eowyn/NN and/CC Galadriel/NN are/VB mostly/RB indistinguishable/VB from/IN each/DT other/JJ visually,/IN the/DT Balrog/NN and/CC Treebeard/NN were/VB unimpressive,/NN but/CC these/DT points/NN didn't/NN bother/VB me/PRP very/RB much./RP However,/NN the/DT Nazgul/NN are/VB aptly/RB drawn/VB and/CC made/VB sufficiently/RB eerie./VB The/DT only/JJ character/NN representation/NN I/PRP was/VB bothered/VB by/IN was/VB Sam's;/NN he/PRP was/VB made/VB to/TO look/VB unbecomingly/DT silly.<br/NN /><br/IN />This/DT film/NN is/VB novel/NN for/IN its/PRP$ animation/NN techniques./NN In/IN addition/NN to/TO hand-drawn/VB characters,/DT live/JJ actors/NN are/VB incorporated/NN into/IN the/DT animation/NN through/IN rotoscoping./VB It/PRP is/VB quite/RB apparent/JJ which/WH characters/NN are/VB hand-drawn/NN and/CC which/WH are/VB rotoscoped,/NN but/CC none/NN the/DT less/JJ I/PRP found/VB that/IN the/DT film's/NN style/NN was/VB a/DT

/><br/DT />The/NN voice/NN acting/VB was/VB generally/RB of/IN high/JJ quality./NN Particularly/RB good/JJ was/VB John/NN Hurt,/NN who/WH provided/VB an/DT authoritative/NN voice/NN for/RP Aragorn./NN Aragorn/NN isn't/IN a/DT favorite/JJ character/NN of/IN mine/NN from/IN the/DT stories,/NN but/CC backed/VB by/IN John/NN Hurt's/NN voice/NN he/PRP was/VB my/PRP$ favorite/JJ character/NN in/IN this/DT adaptation./VB My/PRP$ other/JJ favorite/NN was/VB William/NN Squire,/NN whose/WH$ voice/NN is/VB appropriately/RB strong/JJ for/RP Gandalf./NN The/DT only/JJ actor/NN who/WH seemed/VB inappropriate/JJ was/VB Michael/NN Scholes/NN as/RB Sam,/NN whose/WH$ voice/NN acting/VB was/VB irritating/NN and/CC added/VB to/TO Sam's/NN unfortunately/RB silly/JJ image./IN The/DT only/JJ other/JJ bothersome/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT voice/NN acting/VB is/VB the/DT mispronunciation/NN of/IN character/NN and/CC place/NN names./VB Particularly/RB strange/JJ was/VB the/DT decision/NN to/TO frequently/RB have/VB Saruman/NN referred/VB to/TO as/RB "Aruman".<br/VB /><br/DT />In/NN producing/VB this/DT film,/NN Ralph/NN Bakshi/NN expected/VB to/TO have/VB the/DT ability/NN to/TO produce/VB two/CD films./TO Hence,/NN this/DT film/NN contains/VB about/IN half/PDT the/DT story,/NN from/IN the/DT start/VB of/RP "The/RP Fellowship/NN of/IN the/DT Ring"/NN to/TO the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT battle/NN at/RP Helm's/NN Deep/NN in/IN "The/$ Two/CD Towers"./NN The/DT obvious/JJ implication/NN of/IN this/DT is/VB that/IN the/DT film's/NN story/NN is/VB a/DT highly/RB condensed/JJ version/NN of/IN the/DT story/NN from/IN the/DT books./NN I/PRP enjoy/VB the/DT original/JJ stories/NN and/CC more/RB thorough/JJ adaptations,/NN but/CC the/DT liberties/NN taken/VB to/TO compress/VB the/DT

film/NN to/TO keep/VB me/PRP engaged/VB for/IN the/DT duration/NN and/CC there/EX was/VB even/RB a/DT novelty/NN in/IN being/VB able/JJ to/TO breeze/NN through/IN half/PDT the/DT Lord/NN of/IN the/DT
