After/IN Watergate,/NN Vietnam/NN and/CC the/DT dark/JJ days/NN of/IN the/DT Nixon/NN and/CC Jimmy/NN Carter/NN eras,/. what/WH the/DT world/NN needed/VB was/VB a/DT good/JJ old-fashioned/NN chapter-play/NN hero/NN taking/VB on/IN venomous/DT serpents/NN and/CC evildoers/NN in/IN the/DT America/NN of/RP 1936/CD or/CC the/DT jungles/NN of/IN South/NN America/NN in/IN a/DT series/NN of/IN

said/VB of/IN legendary/JJ producer/NN George/NN Pal's/NN final/JJ film/NN is/VB that/IN his/PRP$ often/RB beautifully/VB designed/VB but/CC sadly/RB flat/JJ adaptation/NN of/IN Kenneth/NN

of/IN the/DT problem/NN is/VB that/WH Doc/NN Savage/NN is/VB in/IN many/JJ ways/NN even/RB harder/RB to/TO write/VB for/IN than/IN Superman/NN /IN explorer,/DT adventurer,/NN philanthropist,/IN a/DT scientific/JJ and/CC intellectual/JJ genius/NN in/IN the/DT bronzed/NN bleach-blonde/IN bulletproof/DT muscle-bound/NN body/NN of/IN a/DT Greek/JJ God/NN (or/VB rather/RB the/DT form/VB of/RP TV's/NN

what/WH kind/NN of/IN hero/NN takes/VB a/DT criminal/JJ lawyer/NN with/IN him/PRP on/IN his/PRP$ adventures?/NN In/IN reality/NN Doc's/NN brain/NN trust/NN were/VB probably/RB added/VB because/IN with/IN the/DT hero/NN so/IN tiresomely/DT invulnerable/NN and/CC practically/RB perfect/JJ in/IN every/DT way/NN /VB even/RP Kryptonite/NN wouldn't/NN put/VB a/DT dent/NN in/IN him/PRP -/. there/EX needed/VB to/TO be/VB someone/NN at/IN risk/NN in/IN the/DT stories,/NN though/IN with/IN the/DT exception/NN of/IN Paul/NN Gleason/NN they're/IN all/DT so/RB horribly/VB badly/RB cast/VB and/CC

with/IN Paul/NN Wexler/NN exuding/IN all/PDT the/DT menace/NN of/IN a/DT geography/NN teacher/NN as/RB Captain/NN Seas,/NN Scott/NN Walker/NN (no,/IN a/DT different/JJ one)/NN delivering/VB one/CD of/IN cinema's/DT worst/JJ accents/NN (is/. it/PRP meant/VB to/TO be/VB Scottish,/NN Irish,/NN Welsh,/NN Greek,/NN Pakistani/NN or/CC some/DT nationality/NN no-one/NN has/VB ever/RB heard/VB of?)/NN while/IN Robyn/NN Hilton's/NN Marilyn/NN Monroe-ish/NN dumb/JJ blonde/JJ moll/NN gives/VB Paris/NN (no/NN relation)/IN a/DT run/NN for/IN her/PRP$ money/NN in/IN the/DT untalented/NN bimbo/IN

tribes,/IN a/DT pool/NN of/IN gold,/IN a/DT dogfight/NN with/IN a/DT biplane/NN and/CC a/DT deadly/JJ poison/NN that/WH comes/VB alive,/IN all/DT wrapped/VB up/RP in/IN a/DT quest/NN to/TO discover/VB

prone/JJ to/TO state-of-the-art/JJ action/NN scenes/NN and/CC special/JJ effects/NN but/CC were/VB treated/VB as/RB somewhat/RB comical/JJ figures/NN of/IN low-budget/JJ camp/NN fun/NN with/IN

to/TO begin/VB with./NN After/IN all,/NN it's/IN hard/JJ to/TO see/VB how/WH one/CD of/IN the/DT villain's/NN underlings/NN making/VB phone/NN calls/VB from/IN a/DT giant/JJ rocking/NN crib/NN was/VB

his/PRP$ sixth/JJ sense/NN by,/NN er,/NN bobbing/IN his/PRP$ Adam's/NN apple.<br/NN /><br/NN />Perhaps/IN an/DT even/RB bigger/JJ problem/NN is/VB that,/NN while/IN promising/JJ on/IN paper,/IN the/DT
