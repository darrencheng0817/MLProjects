Having/VB ran/VB across/IN this/DT film/NN on/IN the/DT Fox/NN movie/NN channel/NN on/IN a/DT lazy/JJ Friday/NN afternoon,/.

all.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT first/JJ thing/NN to/TO keep/VB in/IN mind/NN when/WH watching/VB a/DT film/NN like/IN April/NN Love/NN is/VB to/TO remember/VB the/DT era/NN from/IN which/WH it/PRP came,/VB in/IN this/DT case/NN the/DT late/JJ fifties./RP Films/NN were/VB pretty/RB much/RB a/DT happy/JJ medium/NN back/RB then./VB The/DT cinemas/NN were/VB devoid/JJ of/IN tragedy/NN while/IN the/DT screens/NN were/VB filled/VB with/IN wide/JJ screen/NN Technicolor/NN films/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO pry/VB people/NN away/RB from/IN the/DT gray/JJ glare/NN of/IN the/DT evil/JJ medium/NN in/IN a/DT box/NN called/VB television./IN I/PRP don't/MD know/VB how/WH many/JJ people/NN were/VB pried/VB away/RP from/IN the/DT boob/NN tube/NN to/TO see/VB this/DT one,/NN but/CC it/PRP managed/VB to/TO capture/VB my/PRP$ attention/NN for/IN 97/CD minutes.<br/NN /><br/VB />Teen/RP Idol/NN Pat/NN Boone/NN plays/VB Nick/NN Conover,/NN a/DT young/JJ teen/NN sent/VB to/TO live/VB with/IN his/PRP$ Aunt/NN Henrietta/NN (Jeanette/RP Nolan)/NN and/CC Uncle/NN Jed/NN (Arthur/RP O'Connell)/NN out/RP in/IN the/DT country/NN after/IN being/VB put/VB on/IN probation/NN for/IN stealing/VB a/DT car./NN It/PRP

Henrietta/NN is/VB hoping/VB that/IN Nick/NN being/VB on/IN the/DT farm/NN will/MD somehow/RB bring/VB Jed/NN out/RP of/IN his/PRP$ doldrums./NN Story/NN lines/NN like/IN this/DT being/VB what/WH they/PRP are,/RP Jed/NN and/CC Nick/NN don't/VB really/RB care/VB for/IN each/DT other/JJ too/RB much/RB of/RB course./RP Jed/NN then/RB proceeds/VB to/TO meet/VB up/RP with/IN the/DT neighbors,/RP Fran/NN (Dolores/RP Michaels)and/NN Liz/NN (Shirley/RP Jones)Templeton./NN Immediately/NN Jed/NN develops/VB a/DT crush/VB on/RP Fran,/NN and/CC of/IN course/NN I/PRP don't/MD have/VB to/TO tell/VB you/PRP that/IN Liz/NN develops/VB a/DT crush/VB on/RP Jed./NN Then/RB there's/VB the/DT matter/NN of/IN Uncle/NN Jed's/NN horse,/IN a/DT trotter/NN who/WH has/VB turned/VB wild/JJ and/CC won't/NN let/VB anyone/NN handle/VB him/PRP since/IN the/DT death/NN of/RP Jed/NN Jr./NN You/PRP could/MD probably/RB fill/VB in/IN everything/NN that/WH happens/VB from/IN that/DT point/NN on/IN your/PRP$

the/DT image/NN of/IN squeaky/RB clean/JJ Pat/NN Boone,/NN as/IN a/DT supposedly/RB bad/JJ boy,/NN you'll/NN have/VB no/DT trouble/NN with/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT film./NN Considering/VB that,/DT Boone/NN does/VB turn/VB in/IN a/DT surprisingly/RB good/JJ performance/NN as/RB Nick./NN Certainly/RB the/DT role/NN doesn't/NN require/VB much/JJ depth,/NN but/CC still/RB it's/VB a/DT nicely/RB done/VB job/NN when/WH you/PRP would/MD least/RB expect/VB it./VB As/RB Jed,/NN Arthur/NN O'Connell/NN is/VB the/DT perfect/JJ choice/NN for/IN the/DT role./NN In/IN the/DT early/JJ going,/. he/PRP is/VB unreachable/NN and/CC cold,/NN but/CC as/IN he/PRP slowly/RB warms/VB up/RP to/TO Nick,/NN we/PRP see/VB that/WH he's/VB really/RB a/DT pretty/RB good/JJ guy./RP Jeannette/NN Nolan/NN is/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN fun/NN as/RB Henrietta,/NN who/WH is/VB constantly/RB playing/VB the/DT part/NN of/IN mediator/NN between/IN Jed/NN and/CC Nick./NN Shirley/NN Jones/NN takes/VB a/DT break/NN from/IN Rodgers/NN And/CC Hammerstein/NN and/CC gets/VB a/DT few/JJ opportunities/NN to/TO grace/NN us/PRP with/IN her/PRP singing/VB talents./VB As/RB Liz,/NN she's/NN gorgeous/VB to/TO look/VB at,/DT great/JJ to/TO listen/VB to,/NN and/CC quite/RB funny/JJ at/RP times./RP Dolores/NN Michaels/NN as/RB Fran,/NN who/WH is/VB a/DT bit/NN more/RB on/IN the/DT wild/JJ side,/NN is/VB equally/RB entertaining.<br/VB /><br/IN />The/DT best/JJ thing/NN about/IN April/NN Love,/NN is/VB that/IN there/EX is/VB not/RB a/DT true/JJ mean/JJ conniving/NN character/NN of/IN any/DT sort/NN on/IN the/DT

find/VB it/PRP quite/RB refreshing,/JJ sort/NN of/IN like/IN putting/VB your/PRP$ troubles/NN behind/IN you/PRP and/CC enjoying/VB a/DT summer/NN picnic/NN with/IN friends./NN Think/VB of/IN it/PRP as/IN the/DT old/JJ Andy/NN Griffith/NN show/VB with/IN musical/JJ numbers,/IN a/DT little/JJ more/JJ plot,/NN and/CC wide/JJ screen/NN Technicolor./NN The/DT songs/NN are/VB a/DT mixed/JJ bag,/NN with/IN the/DT title/NN song/NN April/NN Love/NN being/VB the/DT best/JJ of/IN them./IN Another/DT thing/NN I/PRP really/RB liked/VB is/VB that/IN they/PRP didn't/MD fall/VB back/RP on/IN using/VB blue/JJ screen/NN backdrops/NN during/IN the/DT horse/NN racing/NN sequences,/. and/CC they/PRP quite/RB a/DT bit/NN more/RB entertaining/JJ and/CC exciting/JJ because/IN of/IN it./NN As/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN fact,/DT you'll/NN find/VB the/DT whole/JJ film/NN beautifully/NN photographed/. and/CC it/PRP was/VB nice/JJ to/TO see/VB they/PRP didn't/VB skimp/NN in/IN that/WH department./VB The/DT chemistry/NN between/IN Jones/NN and/CC Boone/NN is/VB good./VB Best/RB of/IN all/DT is/VB how/WH the/DT dislike/NN between/IN Nick/NN and/CC Jed/NN is/VB portrayed/VB as/IN each/DT try/VB in/IN some/DT way/NN to/TO gain/VB the/DT others/NN respect.<br/IN /><br/DT />This/NN movie/NN will/MD never/RB be/VB confused/JJ with/IN great/JJ cinema./RP Yet,/NN sometimes/RB instead/RB of/IN going/VB to/TO Disneyland,/NN one/NN just/RB needs/VB a/DT nice/JJ outing/NN in/IN the/DT park,/NN and/CC that's/NN what/WH April/NN Love/NN is.<br/NN /><br/VB />My/RP Grade:/NN B+<br/NN /><br/NN
