Okay.../NN it/PRP seems/VB like/IN so/RB far,/VB only/RB the/DT Barman/NN fans/NN have/VB commented/VB on/IN this/DT film/NN -/. time/NN for/IN a/DT counterpoint./RP Beware,/NN this/DT writeup/NN is/VB *LONG*.<br/DT /><br/NN />For/IN those/DT not/RB in/IN the/DT knowing/VB (mostly/IN the/DT non-Belgians)/NN :/. Tom/NN Barman,/NN director/NN of/IN this/DT film,/NN is/VB the/DT frontman/NN of/IN dEUS,/$ one/CD of/IN the/DT better/RB known/VB rock/NN bands/NN of/IN the/DT late/JJ 90's/NN here/RB in/RP Belgium./NN Basically,/NN they/PRP made/VB a/DT couple/NN of/IN very/RB adventurous/. and/CC innovative/JJ albums/NN and/CC quickly/RB rose/VB to/TO fame/NN on/IN the/DT national/JJ scale./RP Then,/NN egos/NN started/VB hurting/VB and/CC the/DT band/NN basically/RB fell/VB apart,/VB with/RP Barman/NN and/CC a/DT couple/NN of/IN others/NN remaining/VB to/TO go/VB on/IN making/VB albums/NN under/IN the/DT dEUS-monicker./NN The/DT way/NN it/PRP always/RB happens/VB in/IN such/JJ cases,/IN the/DT post-breakdown/NN dEUS/NN was/VB a/DT lot/NN tamer/JJ and/CC less/RB interesting/JJ than/IN the/DT original./NN They/PRP tried/VB to/TO go/VB for/IN an/DT international/JJ breakthrough/NN with/IN their/PRP$ album/NN "The/NN Ideal/NN Crash"/NN in/RP 1999,/CD presenting/VB a/DT much/JJ diluted/JJ form/NN of/IN their/PRP$ earlier/JJ style/NN of/IN songwriting./VB They/PRP didn't/VB quite/RB make/VB it./RP However,/NN egos/NN were/VB still/RB pretty/RB big/JJ it/PRP seems/VB :/. big/JJ enough/JJ for/RP Barman/NN to/TO consider/VB himself/PRP enough/RB of/IN an/DT artist/NN to/TO try/VB on/IN movies.<br/DT /><br/NN />More/VB often/RB than/IN not/RB this/DT sort/NN of/IN thing/NN is/VB a/FW VERY/NN big/JJ mistake,/NN and/CC this/DT film/NN does/VB not/RB make/VB the/DT exception./NN And/CC Barman/NN clearly/RB went/VB for/IN *art*/NN on/IN this/DT one,/NN another/DT very/RB big/JJ mistake./NN For/IN one/CD thing,/NN he's/IN a/DT musician,/NN not/RB a/DT movie/NN director./NN For/IN another,/DT dEUS/NN at/IN it's/NN best/RB made/VB fun/NN and/CC provoking/JJ music,/NN but/CC never/RB anything/NN close/VB to/TO what/WH I/PRP would/MD consider/VB *art*./IN It/PRP shows.<br/VB /><br/DT />So,/NN what's/IN this/DT movie/NN about?/RP Basically,/NN it/PRP tells/VB the/DT story/NN of/IN a/DT bunch/NN of/IN completely/RB uninteresting/JJ people,/NN doing/VB equally/RB uninteresting/JJ things/NN over/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN a/DT totally/RB uninteresting/VB friday/VB in/RP Antwerp,/NN as/IN even/RB more/JJ uninteresting/NN stuff/NN happens/VB to/TO them/PRP in/IN the/DT act/NN of/IN being/VB uninteresting./IN The/DT characters/NN are/VB shallow,/IN the/DT plot/NN totally/RB pointless/. and/CC the/DT film/NN just/RB doesn't/VB have/VB any/DT other/JJ redeeming/VB qualities/NN to/TO make/VB up/RP for/IN these/DT shortcomings./RP Humor?/NN The/DT whole/JJ film/NN made/VB me/PRP smile/VB (slightly)/NN about/IN 3/CD times,/NN and/CC actually/RB managed/VB to/TO provoke/VB a/DT single/VB 5-second/CD laugh/NN (not/VB quite/RB loud)./RP Mood?/NN The/DT film/NN just/RB doesn't/VB seem/VB to/TO show/VB any/DT kind/NN of/IN emotion/NN or/CC feeling/VB at/RP all./RP Mystery?/NN Well,/NN (*MINOR/RP SPOILER*)the/NN idea/NN of/IN the/DT "wind-man",/JJ inspiring/JJ the/DT name/NN of/IN the/DT film,/NN is/VB as/IN enthralling/NN as/IN a/DT banana/NN pepper/NN pizza/NN -/. not/RB very,/. and/CC has/VB been/VB done/VB a/DT thousand/CD times/NN before/IN (anyone/NN remember/VB Johny/NN Destiny/NN -/. one/PRP of/RP Tarantino's/NN worst/JJ appearances/NN on/IN film/NN to/TO date)(*END/VB MINOR/JJ SPOILER*)./NN And/CC well,/VB its/PRP$ *artistic*,/NN so/RB don't/VB expect/VB any/DT kind/NN of/IN real/JJ action/NN to/TO make/VB up/RP for/IN all/PDT the/DT previous./NN In/IN other/JJ words,/NN except/IN for/IN the/DT few/JJ smiles,/. it/PRP bored/JJ me/PRP out/RP of/IN my/PRP$ shorts.<br/NN /><br/NN />So/. what/WH remains?/TO Well,/NN the/DT soundtrack/NN is/VB pretty/RB good,/VB though/IN it/PRP suffers/VB from/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT same/JJ problems/NN that/IN other/JJ OST's/NN have/VB shown/VB lately/RB :/. first,/'' it/PRP makes/VB the/DT movie/NN seem/VB like/IN nothing/NN more/RB than/IN a/DT commercial/JJ for/IN the/DT CD./NN Second,/NN it/PRP gives/VB the/DT impression/NN that/WH Barman/NN is/VB trying/VB to/TO hide/VB the/DT weaknesses/NN and/CC lack/NN of/IN emotional/JJ content/NN in/IN the/DT film/NN behind/IN the/DT content/JJ quality/NN of/IN the/DT songs,/NN which/WH simply/RB doesn't/JJ work./NN In/IN the/DT end,/NN it/PRP makes/VB the/DT film/NN look/VB like/IN nothing/NN more/RB than/IN an/DT illustration/NN to/TO the/DT songs./NN And/CC sadly,/VB it's/RP Barmans/NN own/JJ contribution/NN to/TO the/DT soundtrack/NN which/WH gets/VB the/DT most/JJ attention,/NN though/IN it/PRP is/VB the/DT weakest/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT whole/JJ soundtrack/NN as/IN far/RB as/RB I'm/NN concerned./IN All/DT in/IN all,/VB it/PRP just/RB stands/VB to/TO show/VB that/WH Barman/NN knows/VB more/RB about/IN music/NN than/IN movies./DT Camera/NN work/NN is/VB okay/JJ as/IN well,/NN though/IN not/RB anything/NN that/WH would/MD make/VB you/PRP scream/VB out/RP with/IN joy.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT only/JJ thing/NN about/IN this/DT movie/NN that/WH kept/VB me/PRP watching/VB was/VB the/DT sight-seeing/NN factor./NN Since/IN I/PRP originate/VB from/IN Antwerp,/NN it/PRP was/VB fun/NN to/TO play/VB a/DT kind/NN of/IN "guess-the-location"/NN game./. I/PRP would/MD hardly/RB consider/VB this/DT as/IN a/DT quality/NN though.<br/IN /><br/DT />All/NN in/IN all,/IN another/DT chance/NN lost/VB for/RP Flemmish/NN film./. I/PRP keep/VB on/IN noticing/NN that/WH lately,/VB the/DT best/JJ Belgian/JJ movies/NN have/VB been/VB coming/VB from/IN the/DT French/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT country./NN This/DT is/VB mostly/RB because/IN at/IN least,/VB they/PRP have/VB something/NN to/TO tell/VB and/CC manage/VB to/TO tell/VB it/PRP in/IN way/NN that/WH is/VB both/DT sharp/JJ and/CC emotional/JJ (the/NN brothers/NN Daerden/NN come/VB to/TO mind)./VB Maybe/RB the/DT Flemmish/NN art-house/. filmmakers/PRP should/MD try/VB that/IN too./DT
