Alright,/NN this/DT film/NN is/VB the/DT representation/NN of/IN several/JJ things./NN For/IN starters,/IN this/DT film/NN is/VB about/IN a/DT disgruntled/JJ student/NN who/WH brings/VB a/DT gun/NN to/TO school/NN and/CC shoots/VB roughly/RB 9/CD students./CD One/CD student/NN survives/VB and/CC is/VB in/IN the/DT hospital/NN with/IN extensive/JJ head/NN injuries./IN The/DT lead/JJ character/NN is/VB what/WH several/JJ people/NN who/WH consider/VB a/DT 'loner/goth',/NN despite/IN the/DT movie's/NN stating/VB of/IN her/PRP$ not/RB being/VB so./IN She/PRP seems/VB quite/RB mysterious,/. but/CC was/VB also/RB the/DT only/JJ unharmed/NN student/NN in/IN the/DT victimized/VB classroom./RP She's/NN questioned,/IN due/JJ to/TO having/VB a/DT history/NN of/IN knowing/VB the/DT shooter/NN and/CC having/VB a/DT record/NN of/IN being/VB on/IN the/DT phone/NN with/IN him/PRP the/DT night/NN before./RP Anyhow,/NN she's/IN a/DT very/RB brief/JJ and/CC distant/JJ person/NN who/WH seems/VB to/TO despise/VB society./RP Yet,/NN due/JJ to/TO some,/VB at/IN first/JJ unexplained/JJ events,/. she/PRP spent/VB roughly/RB a/DT year/NN out/RP of/IN school,/NN failing/VB the/DT grade./NN She/PRP has/VB the/DT desire/NN to/TO graduate,/NN and/CC the/DT principle/NN practically/RB cons/VB her/PRP into/IN the/DT only/JJ possible/JJ way/NN she/PRP can/MD pass/VB is/VB to/TO spend/VB time/NN with/IN the/DT survivor,/NN the/DT girl/NN in/IN the/DT hospital.<br/NN /><br/IN />These/$ two/CD leads/NN are/VB nearly/RB entirely/RB opposite,/. and/CC they/PRP are/VB quite/RB that/IN on/IN a/DT social/JJ level./NN While/IN Alisha/NN is/VB a/DT quiet,/NN inwardly/IN disturbed,/DT anti-social/JJ 'goth'/NN girl/NN who/WH spends/VB her/PRP$ time/NN entirely/RB alone/RB (even/VB though/IN she/PRP seems/VB to/TO read/VB quite/RB often,/VB somewhat/RB of/IN a/DT closet/out/NN of/IN the/DT closet/NN bookworm),/IN the/DT other/JJ girl/NN is/VB a/DT rich,/JJ popular/JJ 'bubbly'/NN girl/NN who/WH seems/VB always/RB incredibly/RB optimistic/JJ and/CC trapped/VB in/IN her/PRP$ own/JJ fantasy/NN world,/NN ignoring/VB the/DT outside/JJ world/NN and/CC its/PRP$ realism/NN to/TO survive./VB I/PRP feel/VB both/DT of/IN these/DT roles/NN to/TO a/DT marvelous/NN job/NN of/IN representing/VB MOST/NN 'cliques'/NN in/IN the/DT modern/JJ highschool,/NN but/CC more/RB importantly/RB shows/VB how/WH two/CD entirely/RB opposite/JJ girls/NN who/WH know/VB nothing/NN of/IN each/DT other/JJ eventually/RB open/VB to/TO each/DT other./NN While/IN the/DT injured/JJ girl/NN learns/IN a/DT deep,/JJ meaningful/JJ truth/NN on/IN her/PRP$ once/RB sheltered/JJ life/NN and/CC the/DT outside/JJ world,/RP Alisha/NN learns/NN that/IN complete/JJ abandonment/NN of/IN society/NN and/CC locking/VB everything/NN inside/RB is/VB not/RB always/RB the/DT best/JJ thing.<br/NN /><br/IN />Many/DT people/NN will/MD look/VB to/TO the/DT connection/NN between/IN these/DT two/CD girls/NN and/CC see/VB one/CD of/IN two/CD things./TO Either,/NN a/DT snobby,/NN hateful/NN girl/NN who/WH wants/VB he/PRP rest/VB of/IN the/DT world/NN to/TO suffer/VB as/IN she/PRP does,/MD taking/VB it/PRP out/RP on/IN an/DT innocent/JJ girl,/RP OR/NN the/DT story/NN of/IN a/DT seemingly/RB trapped,/VB fantasized/DT girl/NN who/WH meets/VB an/DT outcast/NN to/TO society/NN and/CC learns/VB not/RB only/RB not/RB to/TO judge,/NN but/CC that/WH she/PRP is/VB actually,/IN perhaps,/$ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/JJ intelligent/JJ people/NN she's/NN known./NN In/IN other/JJ words,/NN people/NN may/MD see/VB this/DT film/NN as/IN a/DT focus/VB on/RP Alisha/NN teaching/VB the/DT other/JJ girl/NN a/DT lesson/NN about/IN life,/NN but/CC it/PRP isn't/VB about/IN that.<br/DT /><br/NN />This/NN film/NN is/VB about/RP SEVERAL/NN things./NN While/IN it/PRP is/VB about/IN all/DT I/PRP have/VB stated,/IN it/PRP is/VB also/RB representative/JJ of/IN how/WH people/NN deal/NN from/IN a/DT large,/NN life-changing/VB catastrophe./RP Truly,/NN this/DT movie/NN is/VB not/RB very/RB symbolic,/. but/CC instead/RB incredibly/RB straight/RB forward/RB with/IN its/PRP$ message,/NN as/IN long/JJ as/IN you/PRP aren't/VB afraid/JJ to/TO open/VB your/PRP$ mind,/NN and/CC your/PRP$ heart,/NN to/TO some/DT emotions/NN you/PRP may/MD not/RB be/VB familiar/JJ with/IN being/VB portrayed/VB so/RB miraculously.<br/JJ /><br/NN />Overall,/IN this/DT film/NN is/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT best/RB I've/NN ever/RB seen./VB The/DT acting/NN is/VB brilliant,/IN the/DT storyline/NN and/CC representation/NN is/VB deep/JJ and/CC meaningful,/NN and/CC the/DT emotion/NN flowing/VB through-out/IN this/DT film/NN will/MD have/VB anyone/NN not/RB only/RB relating,/. but/CC possibly/RB crying./VB This/DT film/NN is/VB by/IN far/RB heart-wrenching,/. and/CC very/RB impactful,/. and/CC if/IN I/PRP ever/RB believed/VB any/DT film/NN could/MD alter/VB a/DT person's/NN life.../IN this/DT would/MD be/VB the/DT first/JJ that/WH could/MD have/VB changed/VB mine.<br/IN /><br/DT />I/NN adored/IN this/DT movie,/NN if/IN you/PRP ever/RB want/VB a/DT movie/NN that's/NN moving/VB and/CC impactful,/NN while/IN incredibly/RB entertaining/JJ and/CC REAL,/NN watch/VB this./DT
