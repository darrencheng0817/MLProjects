The/DT main/JJ reason/NN people/NN still/RB care/VB about/IN "Carlton-Browne/NN Of/IN The/DT F.O."/NN is/VB that/IN it/PRP features/VB Peter/NN Sellers/NN in/IN a/DT second-billed/NN role./. But/CC watching/VB this/DT film/NN to/TO see/VB Peter/NN Sellers/NN is/VB a/DT mistake.<br/NN /><br/NN />Sellers/NN plays/VB Amphibulos,/NN a/DT vaguely/NN reptilian/IN prime/JJ minister/NN of/IN

instead/RB by/IN Ian/NN Bannen/NN as/IN King/NN Loris,/NN who/WH inherits/VB the/DT throne/VB of/RP Gaillardia/NN after/IN his/PRP$ father's/NN assassination./RP Bannen/NN is/VB dull/JJ and/CC
