I'm/NN a/DT 53/CD year-old/NN college/NN professor./. I/PRP went/VB with/IN my/PRP$ wife/NN and/CC 12/CD year/NN old/JJ daughter./. We/PRP all/RB enjoyed/VB the/DT movie./NN The/DT film/NN is/VB original,/IN witty,/DT fast-paced/JJ and/CC totally/RB charming./VB The/DT plot/NN was/VB easy/JJ enough/JJ for/IN a/DT 10/CD year/NN old/JJ to/TO follow,/NN but/CC twisty/DT enough/JJ to/TO keep/VB an/DT adult/NN interested./. I/PRP thought/VB Emma/NN Roberts/NN did/VB a/DT superb/NN job/NN and/CC the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT cast/NN was/VB just/RB fine./VB My/PRP$ only/JJ criticism/NN is/VB that/IN the/DT Los/NN Angeles/NN sets/VB were/VB not/RB as/IN interesting/JJ as/IN they/PRP should/MD have/VB been./IN They/PRP were/VB functional,/NN but/CC nothing/NN stood/VB out./NN On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand,/NN make-up,/IN costume,/DT lighting,/NN cinematography,/NN editing/. and/CC directing/NN were/VB excellent./RP Altogether,/NN I/PRP thought/VB it/PRP was/VB a/DT totally/RB enjoyable/JJ experience./. I/PRP am/VB disappointed/VB that/IN the/DT professional/JJ critics/NN (almost/IN all/DT adult/JJ males)/NN savagely/NN attacked/VB the/DT film./RP Apparently,/NN they/PRP have/VB something/NN against/IN films/NN that/WH portray/VB strong,/DT intelligent/JJ and/CC independent/JJ young/JJ women./IN Their/PRP$ writings/NN reveal/VB more/RB about/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ sexist/NN natures/NN than/IN anything/NN about/IN this/DT wonderful/JJ family/NN film./.
