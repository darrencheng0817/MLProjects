After/IN watching/VB Awake,I/NN led/VB to/TO a/DT conclusion:director/NN and/CC screenwriter/RP Joby/NN Harold/NN made/VB Awake/NN with/IN the/DT intention/NN of/IN laughing/VB at/IN the/DT spectator,for/NN the/DT simple/JJ fact/NN the/DT movie/NN is/VB full/JJ of/IN ridiculous/JJ elements.Awake/NN has/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN plot/NN holes/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VB full/JJ of/IN absurd/JJ and/CC ridiculous/JJ elements(for/NN example,the/NN hospital/NN uniform/NN the/DT spirit/NN of/IN the/DT main/JJ character/NN uses...did/IN the/DT ghost/NN of/IN a/DT doctor/NN leave/VB it/PRP in/IN the/DT floor/NN ?).The/NN concept/NN behind/IN this/DT movie/NN is/VB slightly/RB ingenious/JJ but/CC all/PDT the/DT plot/NN holes/NN and/CC the/DT absurd/JJ things/NN make/VB of/IN this/DT a/DT stupid/JJ and/CC crappy/NN film.With/IN the/DT exception/NN of/IN the/DT great/JJ Lena/NN Olin,all/NN the/DT actors/NN bring/VB bad/JJ performances.Hayden/NN Christensen/NN has/VB zero/CD expressions/NN and/CC the/DT same/JJ applies/VB for/IN Jessica/NN Alba.The/NN extraordinary/JJ actor/NN Terrence/NN Howard/NN is/VB enormously/DT wasted/NN on/IN his/PRP$ role.Awake/NN makes/VB a/DT laugh/NN of/IN the/DT spectator.It's/NN so/RB ridiculous/JJ and/CC full/JJ of/IN absurd/JJ things/NN that/IN it's/DT impossible/JJ to/TO take/VB it/PRP seriously.My/VB recommendation/NN is:skip/IN this/DT crappy/NN movie./NN
