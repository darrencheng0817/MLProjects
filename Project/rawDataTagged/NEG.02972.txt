Wow./NN Watching/NN this/DT film/NN today,/. you/PRP can't/MD help/VB but/CC be/VB appalled/VB by/IN the/DT writing/NN of/IN this/DT film./NN Spencer/NN Tracy/NN and/CC Loretta/NN Young/NN play/VB a/DT couple/NN who,/NN in/IN modern/JJ times,/NN might/MD be/VB featured/VB on/IN "The/DT Jerry/NN Springer/NN Show"--as/NN they/PRP have/VB a/DT sick/JJ and/CC abusive/JJ relationship...and/NN inexplicably,/IN the/DT writers/NN appear/VB to/TO be/VB endorsing/VB it!/DT <br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT film/NN begins/VB with/IN a/DT hungry/JJ and/CC homeless/JJ Loretta/NN being/VB shown/VB the/DT ropes/NN by/IN the/DT poor/JJ but/CC very/RB resourceful/JJ Spencer/NN Tracy./NN He/PRP shows/VB her/PRP how/WH by/IN conniving/VB you/PRP can/MD do/VB very/RB well/RB with/IN little/JJ money/NN and/CC takes/VB her/PRP$ home/NN to/TO his/PRP$ shack/NN to/TO stay./PRP$ It's/NN never/RB clear/JJ whether/IN or/CC not/RB they/PRP marry--and/MD considering/VB it's/DT a/FW Pre-Code/NN film,/. you/PRP can/MD assume/VB they/PRP aren't/VB even/RB though/IN they/PRP are/VB cohabiting./IN Their/PRP$ relationship/NN is/VB very/RB strange...and/VB rather/RB sick./VB While/IN you/PRP can/MD see/VB that/WH Tracy/NN cares/VB about/IN her/PRP by/IN his/PRP$ actions,/NN he/PRP is/VB verbally/RB abusive/JJ and/CC a/DT total/JJ jerk---and/NN Young/NN comes/VB running/VB back/RP for/IN more/JJ like/IN some/DT sort/NN of/IN dog./VB He/PRP calls/VB her/PRP$ "skinny"/NN or/CC "ugly"/NN and/CC these/DT are,/NN in/IN a/DT sick/JJ way,/IN his/PRP$ way/NN of/IN using/VB endearments!/RP Later,/NN when/WH he/PRP starts/VB fooling/VB around/RP with/IN another/DT woman/NN (Glenda/RP Farrell),/NN she/PRP tells/VB her/PRP$ friend/NN that/IN if/IN that's/NN what/WH he/PRP wants,/VB it's/DT okay/JJ with/IN her!!!/VB It/PRP sure/RB smacks/VB of/IN a/DT sado-masochistic/NN relationship/NN and/CC you/PRP can't/MD help/VB but/CC feel/VB a/DT bit/NN horrified./RP Sure,/NN he/PRP doesn't/MD hit/VB her/PRP but/CC the/DT relationship/NN is/VB very/RB abusive./VB To/TO show/VB how/WH sick/JJ it/PRP is,/VB when/WH Young/NN gets/VB pregnant,/IN she/PRP tells/VB him/PRP "...it's/VB your/PRP$ baby/NN and/CC it's/NN mine,/. but/CC you/PRP don't/MD need/VB to/TO worry,/PRP$ I'll/NN take/VB all/PDT the/DT blame/VB for/RP it"!!/RP Yikes!/NN Doesn't/NN this/DT all/RB seem/VB a/DT bit/NN like/IN looking/VB through/IN a/DT peephole/NN into/IN a/DT sick/JJ and/CC dysfunctional/VB home?!/RP Later,/NN in/IN a/DT case/NN of/IN art/NN imitating/VB life,/RP Tracy/NN proves/VB what/WH sort/VB of/IN man/NN he/PRP is/VB and/CC disappears./NN After/IN all,/VB he/PRP can't/MD be/VB burdened/VB with/IN a/DT baby--even/NN if/IN it's/VB his./RP But,/NN he/PRP changes/VB his/PRP$ mind/NN and/CC decides/VB to/TO return/VB home./RP Wow...that's/NN bit/NN of/RB him!/RP And,/NN when/WH he/PRP returns,/VB he's/DT nasty/JJ and/CC acts/NN like/IN IF/IN he/PRP stays,/VB he/PRP isn't/MD obligated/VB to/TO care/VB for/IN the/DT kid!!/RP And,/NN she/PRP tells/VB him/PRP he's/VB "a/DT free/JJ man...free/NN as/IN a/DT bird"!/RP Wow,/NN I/PRP was/VB almost/RB in/IN tears/NN at/IN this/DT tender/NN moment...NOT!/RP Soon,/NN this/DT crazy/JJ pair/NN are/VB married...and,/IN naturally,/DT Young/NN is/VB depressed/VB because/IN he/PRP seems/VB to/TO be/VB staying/VB as/IN long/JJ as/IN it/PRP suits/VB him--not/NN because/IN of/IN any/DT love/NN or/CC sense/NN of/IN responsibility./NN So/IN how/WH can/MD you/PRP salvage/VB anything/NN with/IN this/DT sort/NN of/IN sick/JJ characters?/NN What/WH would/MD you/PRP do?/RP Well,/NN as/IN for/IN the/DT writers,/NN they/PRP have/VB Tracy/NN soon/RB commit/VB a/DT robbery/NN to/TO help/VB pay/VB for/IN the/DT brat!/NN The/DT romantic/JJ aspects/NN of/IN the/DT film/NN are/VB underwhelming/VB to/TO say/VB the/DT least!/NN During/IN the/DT robbery,/RP Tracy/NN behaves/VB like/IN a/DT chump--doing/NN almost/RB nothing/NN to/TO take/VB precautions/NN not/RB to/TO get/VB caught--like/IN he/PRP was/VB secretly/RB hoping/VB to/TO get/VB sent/VB to/TO prison./PRP$ And,/NN to/TO show/VB what/WH sort/VB of/IN nice/JJ guy/NN he/PRP is,/VB the/DT guy/NN he/PRP tries/VB to/TO rob/VB is/VB one/CD of/IN his/PRP$ best/JJ friends.<br/NN /><br/NN />While/IN there's/DT more/JJ to/TO the/DT film,/NN the/DT bottom/JJ line/NN is/VB that/WH Tracy/NN is/VB a/DT jerk/NN and/CC Young/NN is/VB an/DT idiot/NN in/IN the/DT film./NN Despite/IN both/DT being/VB very/RB good/JJ actors,/NN there's/VB absolutely/RB no/DT way/NN they/PRP could/MD make/VB anything/NN of/IN this/DT crap/NN the/DT writers/NN produced./RP Nice/NN music,/IN nice/JJ sets,/NN good/JJ acting...and/IN a/DT script/NN that/WH is/VB 100%/DT poo./NN How/WH the/DT film/NN is/VB currently/RB rated/VB 7.4/CD is/VB beyond/IN me/PRP and/CC I/PRP wonder/VB how/WH anyone/NN can/MD ignore/VB the/DT pure/JJ awfulness/NN of/IN the/DT characters./NN A/DT horrible/JJ misfire/NN that/IN somehow/RB didn't/VB destroy/VB the/DT careers/NN of/IN those/DT involved.<br/NN /><br/NN />Oh,/. and/CC if/IN you/PRP wonder/VB if/IN Loretta/NN EVER/NN gets/VB a/DT backbone/NN in/IN this/DT film/NN or/CC plays/VB a/DT person/NN who/WH is/VB the/DT least/JJ bit/NN strong,/IN the/DT answer/NN is/VB NO!/NN By/IN the/DT end,/NN she's/NN learned/VB nothing/NN and/CC hasn't/NN changed/VB one/CD whit/NN for/IN the/DT better.<br/NN /><br/IN />They/DT sure/JJ don't/NN make/VB films/NN like/IN they/PRP used/VB to...and/NN in/IN this/DT case...thank/RP God!/NN
