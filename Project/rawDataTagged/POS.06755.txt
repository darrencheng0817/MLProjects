The/DT 63/CD year/NN reign/NN of/IN Queen/NN Victoria/NN is/VB perhaps/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RB documented/VB and/CC popularly/NN known/VB historical/JJ reigns/NN in/IN British/JJ history./NN On/IN the/DT one/CD hand,/IN her/PRP$ story/NN lacks/VB the/DT theatrics/NN of/IN earlier/JJ royals/NN thanks/NN to/TO a/DT change/NN in/IN social/JJ climate/NN and/CC attitudes,/NN and/CC on/IN the/DT other/JJ her/PRP$ story/NN is/VB one/CD that/IN perpetuates/NN because/IN it/PRP is/VB notably/RB human./RP Taking/NN on/IN the/DT earlier/JJ years/NN of/IN her/PRP$ life/NN where/WH the/DT

remained/VB in/IN the/DT unbeknownst/NN shadows/NN of/IN the/DT industry/NN here/RB takes/VB Victoria's/NN story/NN and/CC captures/NN that/IN human/JJ element/NN so/RB vital/JJ to/TO her/PRP legacy./RP It's/NN a/DT story/NN that/WH feels/VB extremely/RB humble/JJ considering/VB its/PRP$ exuberant/NN background,/. and/CC yet/RB that's/VB partly/RB what/WH gives/VB it/PRP a/DT distinct/JJ edge/NN here/RB that/WH separates/VB it/PRP from/IN the/DT usual/JJ fare.<br/NN /><br/NN />Taking/IN a/DT very/RB direct/JJ and/CC focused/VB approach/NN that/IN centres/NN in/IN on/IN a/DT brief/JJ five/CD or/CC so/RB year/NN period/NN between/IN her/PRP$ ascension/NN and/CC marriage/NN to/TO Albert,/NN The/DT Young/NN Victoria/NN does/VB what/WH so/RB little/JJ period/NN pieces/NN of/IN this/DT nature/NN offer./VB Instead/RB of/IN attempting/VB a/DT sprawling/VB encapsulation/NN of/IN such/PDT a/DT figure's/JJ entire/JJ life,/RP Vallée/NN instead/RB opts/VB to/TO show/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT lesser/JJ known/VB intricacies/VB of/RP Victoria's/NN early/JJ years/NN which/WH are/VB easily/RB overlooked/VB in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT more/RB publicly/RB known/VB accolades./IN The/DT result/NN is/VB a/DT feature/NN that/WH may/MD disgruntle/VB historians/NN thanks/NN to/TO its/PRP$ relatively/RB flippant/JJ regards/VB to/TO facts/NN and/CC the/DT like,/NN yet/RB never/RB to/TO let/VB document/NN get/VB in/IN the/DT way/NN of/IN extracting/VB a/DT compelling/JJ story,/NN writer/NN Julian/NN Fellowes/NN sticks/VB to/TO his/PRP$ guns/NN and/CC delivers/VB a/DT slightly/RB romanticised/VB yet/RB convincing/VB portrayal./RP Vallée/NN takes/VB this/DT and/CC runs,/NN making/VB sure/JJ to/TO fully/RB capitalise/VB on/IN those/DT elements/NN with/IN enough/JJ restraint/NN to/TO maintain/VB integrity/NN in/IN regards/VB to/TO both/PDT the/DT history/NN involved/VB and/CC the/DT viewer/NN watching.<br/NN /><br/IN />A/DT major/JJ part/NN in/IN the/DT joy/NN of/IN watching/VB The/DT Young/NN Victoria/NN play/VB out/RP however/RB simply/RB lies/VB in/IN the/DT production/NN values/NN granted/VB here/RB that/WH bring/VB early/JJ 1800's/NN Regal/NN Britain/NN to/TO life/NN with/IN a/DT vigorous/JJ realism/NN so/RB rarely/RB achieved/VB quite/RB so/RB strikingly/VB by/IN genre/DT films./NN Everything/NN from/IN the/DT costume/NN designs,/IN sets,/DT hair/NN styles,/NN lighting/NN and/CC photography/NN accentuates/IN the/DT grandiose/JJ background/NN inherent/JJ to/TO Victoria's/NN story/NN without/IN ever/RB over-encumbering/VB it./RP Indeed,/NN while/IN watching/VB Vallée's/NN interpretation/NN come/VB to/TO life/NN here/RB it/PRP is/VB very/RB hard/RB not/RB to/TO be/VB sucked/NN in/IN solely/RB through/IN the/DT aesthetics/NN that/WH permeates/VB the/DT visual/JJ element;/NN and/CC then/RB there's/VB the/DT film's/NN score/VB also/RB which/WH works/VB tremendously/VB to/TO further/RB the/DT very/RB elegant/JJ yet/RB personal/JJ tones/NN that/WH dominate/VB Fellowes'/NN script./RP Entwining/NN the/DT works/VB of/RP Schubert/NN and/CC Strauss/NN into/IN Victoria/NN and/CC Albert's/NN story/NN not/RB only/RB works/VB as/IN a/DT point/NN of/IN reference/NN for/IN the/DT characters/NN to/TO play/VB with,/NN but/CC also/RB melds/VB to/TO the/DT work/NN with/IN an/DT elegance/NN and/CC refrain/NN that/IN echoes/NN composer/NN Ilan/NN Eshkeri's/NN original/JJ work/NN just/RB as/IN well.<br/DT /><br/NN />Yet/NN for/IN all/PDT the/DT poignant/JJ compositions,/NN lush/JJ backdrops/NN and/CC immaculate/NN costumes/NN that/WH

they/PRP help/VB bring/VB the/DT world/NN they/PRP exist/VB in/RP to/TO life./PRP$ Thankfully/NN The/DT Young/NN Victoria/NN is/VB blessed/VB with/IN an/DT equally/RB immaculate/JJ ensemble/NN of/IN
