"Kolchak:/IN the/DT Night/NN Stalker"/NN is/VB a/DT hugely/JJ entertaining/JJ TV/NN series/NN in/IN which/WH a/DT pushy,/NN sarcastic,/IN forty-something/DT reporter/NN is/VB repeatedly/RB drawn/VB into/IN mortal/DT combat/NN with/IN supernatural/DT (and/NN occasionally/RB extraterrestrial)/JJ forces./NN Based/VB on/IN a/DT very/RB popular/JJ pair/NN of/IN TV/NN movies/NN featuring/VB the/DT Kolchak/NN character,/IN this/DT series/NN died/VB a/DT quick/JJ death/NN in/IN the/DT mid-1970s/NN due/JJ to/TO low/JJ ratings,/NN but/CC it/PRP nevertheless/RB maintains/VB a/DT strong/JJ cult/NN following/VB today./NN But/CC will/MD the/DT average/JJ modern-day/JJ viewer/NN be/VB able/JJ to/TO dig/VB Kolchak/NN and/CC his/PRP$ weekly/JJ clashes/NN with/IN the/DT undead?/NN <br/IN /><br/DT />That's/NN actually/RB a/DT tough/JJ question/NN to/TO answer/VB fairly./RP Detractors/NN of/IN this/DT series/NN tend/VB to/TO argue/VB that/IN it's/DT formulaic/NN and/CC hopelessly/RB dated./VB On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand,/NN fans/NN argue/VB that/WH it's/VB cleverly/RB written,/JJ well-acted,/NN and/CC sometimes/RB genuinely/JJ spooky./NN And/CC me?/RP I've/NN got/VB a/DT foot/NN in/IN both/DT camps./NN I/PRP thoroughly/MD enjoyed/VB watching/VB all/DT 20/CD episodes/NN of/RP Kolchak/NN on/RP DVD/NN recently,/NN though/IN I/PRP can/MD plainly/RB see/VB that/IN the/DT series/NN has/VB major/JJ flaws.<br/NN /><br/NN />I'll/NN address/VB the/DT question/NN of/RP Kolchak/NN being/VB "formula"/DT fiction/NN first./RP Now,/NN I/PRP think/VB we/PRP can/MD all/RB agree/VB that/IN most/JJ TV/NN shows/VB have/VB formulas/NN -/. just/RB about/IN every/DT episode/NN of/RP Columbo/NN unfolds/VB according/VB to/TO the/DT same/JJ pattern,/NN for/RP example./RP Repetition/NN is/VB not/RB necessarily/RB a/DT bad/JJ thing/NN in/IN itself;/NN in/IN fact,/DT critics/NN have/VB long/RB recognized/VB that/IN audiences/NN often/RB enjoy,/. and/CC actively/RB seek/VB out,/TO repetitive/VB entertainment./RP However,/NN the/DT problem/NN with/RP Kolchak/NN is/VB that/IN its/PRP$ formula/NN is/VB simply/RB TOO/NN rigid/JJ -/. it's/VB too/RB repetitive/VB even/RB by/IN the/DT most/JJ generous/JJ standards.<br/NN /><br/NN />In/VB almost/RB every/DT episode,/RP Kolchak/NN investigates/VB a/DT murder,/NN and/CC figures/VB out/RP that/IN it/PRP was/VB committed/VB by/IN some/DT form/NN of/IN monster./VB He/PRP tries/VB to/TO publish/VB a/DT story/NN about/IN said/VB monster,/NN but/CC his/PRP$ editor/NN Vincenzo/NN blocks/NN him,/VB always/RB on/IN the/DT grounds/NN that/WH Kolchak/NN doesn't/NN have/VB sufficient/JJ evidence/NN to/TO support/VB his/PRP$ claims/NN that/IN supernatural/DT forces/NN are/VB at/RP work./RP And,/NN alas,/RP Kolchak/NN is/VB also/RB obstructed/VB by/IN the/DT police./RP So,/NN in/IN the/DT end,/RP Kolchak/NN does/VB some/DT independent/JJ research/NN on/IN the/DT monster,/NN figures/NN out/IN how/WH to/TO kill/VB it.../NN and/CC then/RB kills/VB it./NN Without/IN ceremony,/NN or/CC reward,/NN or/CC writing/VB a/DT big/JJ story/NN about/IN it.<br/DT /><br/NN />You/NN can/MD see/VB where/WH this/DT ever-so-strict/NN formula/NN might/MD get/VB tiresome,/VB right?/RP I'm/NN particularly/RB mystified/VB by/RP Vincenzo/NN -/. if/IN Kolchak's/NN always/RB raving/VB about/IN monsters,/NN and/CC Vincenzo/NN never/RB believes/VB it.../DT well,/NN then,/. why/WH doesn't/TO Vincenzo/NN fire/VB Kolchak,/NN or/CC have/VB him/PRP committed?/RP That's/NN what/WH any/DT normal/JJ boss/NN would/MD do./VB But/CC the/DT series/NN eschews/IN such/JJ realism/NN and/CC prefers/VB to/TO keep/VB Vincenzo/NN and/CC Kolchak/NN as/IN comical/DT antagonists./NN As/IN a/DT result,/JJ many/JJ of/IN their/PRP$ scenes/NN together/RB are/VB profoundly/RB unbelievable/VB -/. though/IN they/PRP are/VB also/RB quite/RB funny.<br/JJ /><br/NN />The/VB very/RB best/JJ episodes/NN of/RP Kolchak/NN manage/VB to/TO vault/VB over/IN the/DT limitations/NN of/IN this/DT formula,/NN however,/VB usually/RB because/IN they/PRP contain/VB some/DT kind/NN of/IN unexpected/JJ twist./IN These/DT select/JJ episodes/NN are/VB good/JJ enough/JJ that/IN I/PRP think/VB they're/VB largely/RB immune/JJ to/TO typical/JJ criticisms/NN of/IN the/DT series./NN Some/DT of/IN my/PRP$ favorites/NN include:/IN <br/DT /><br/NN />Horror/NN in/IN the/DT Heights/NN -/. an/DT episode/NN that's/NN noteworthy/NN for/IN being/VB grimy,/DT inventive/NN and/CC socially/RB aware./RP Kolchak's/NN dialog/NN has/VB an/DT unusually/RB sharp/JJ and/CC cynical/JJ edge./NN Though/IN it/PRP adheres/VB closely/RB to/TO the/DT Kolchak/NN formula,/IN the/DT script/NN (written/VB by/RP Hammer/NN Studios/NN veteran/NN Jimmy/NN Sangster)/NN is/VB remarkably/RB literate,/. and/CC it/PRP delves/VB deeply/RB into/IN the/DT monster's/NN backstory.<br/NN /><br/VB />The/RP Devil's/NN Platform/NN -/. a/DT possible/JJ inspiration/NN for/IN the/DT "Omen"/NN films,/IN this/DT episode/NN stands/VB out/RP to/TO me/PRP because/IN the/DT villain/NN -/. a/DT very/RB young/JJ Tom/NN Skerritt/NN -/. tempts/VB Kolchak/NN with/IN a/DT satanic/NN contract/NN full/JJ of/IN goodies/NN (and,/NN in/IN so/RB doing,/VB reveals/VB a/DT lot/NN about/IN the/DT reporter's/NN character.)/IN <br/DT /><br/NN />Firefall/NN -/. this/DT episode/NN appears/VB to/TO have/VB a/DT bad/JJ reputation/NN among/IN fans,/NN but/CC I/PRP enjoyed/VB it/PRP because/IN it's/NN got/VB a/DT great/JJ red/JJ herring/NN and/CC a/DT really/RB creepy,/VB almost/RB unstoppable-seeming/JJ monster.<br/NN /><br/VB />Though/RP I've/NN singled/VB out/RP these/DT three/CD episodes/NN for/RP praise,/RP I'd/NN say/VB that/IN most/JJ of/IN the/DT stories/NN are/VB entertaining/JJ at/IN the/DT very/JJ least./NN For/IN my/PRP$ money,/NN there/EX are/VB only/RB two/CD complete/JJ turkeys/NN in/IN the/DT 20-episode/CD run:/TO Primal/NN Scream,/NN which/WH is/VB about/IN monkey-men/NN running/VB rampant/JJ in/RP Chicago,/NN and/CC the/DT Sentry,/NN which/WH features/VB the/DT dumbest-looking/NN creature/NN makeup/NN in/IN the/DT history/NN of/IN filmed/VB entertainment/NN (and/IN this/DT assessment/NN is/VB coming/VB from/IN a/DT lifelong/JJ Doctor/NN Who/WH and/CC Godzilla/NN fan!)/IN <br/DT /><br/NN />On/NN balance,/NN then,/IN this/DT is/VB a/DT good/JJ series./IN A/DT little/JJ repetitive,/IN a/DT little/JJ cheesy/NN perhaps,/. but/CC it/PRP has/VB elements/NN of/IN greatness./NN Even/RB during/IN the/DT weaker/JJ episodes,/RP Darren/NN McGavin's/NN wonderful/JJ performance/NN as/IN the/DT caustic,/NN world-weary,/IN endlessly/DT funny/JJ Kolchak/NN truly/RB shines./VB He/PRP carries/VB the/DT series/NN effortlessly,/NN in/IN a/DT way/NN that,/NN for/IN example,/DT Sarah/NN Michelle/NN Gellar/NN never/RB managed/VB on/RP "Buffy."/RP McGavin/NN was/VB one/CD great/JJ character/NN actor,/. and/CC this/DT series/NN is/VB worth/JJ watching/NN for/IN him/PRP alone./VB
