i/FW expected/JJ something/NN different:more/NN passion,drama...Again/IN another/DT failed/JJ attempt/NN of/IN originality.i'm/DT sorry/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN the/DT film/NN falls/VB into/IN the/DT old/JJ clich√©/NN of/IN 'cheesiness'.15/DT year/NN old/JJ teens/NN may/MD appreciate/VB it/PRP though.The/MD acting/VB was/VB not/RB very/RB convincing/JJ and/CC the/DT lines/NN common,lacking/IN any/DT wit.Still,/NN the/DT soundtrack/NN was/VB good/JJ and/CC well/RB adapted.I/JJ can't/NN say/VB that/IN this/DT movie/NN is/VB a/DT total/JJ flop,because/NN people/NN do/VB watch/VB it/PRP but/CC it/PRP didn't/MD meet/VB the/DT public's/NN expectations/NN and/CC sunk/VB into/IN mediocrity.So,to/DT conclude,the/NN production/NN keeps/VB you/PRP in/IN front/NN of/IN the/DT TV/NN for/IN almost/RB an/DT hour/NN and/CC a/DT half,which/NN is/VB an/DT appreciable/NN thing.Thus,I/NN guess/VB its/PRP$ worth/NN seeing/VB if/IN you/PRP don't/MD get/VB annoyed/JJ
