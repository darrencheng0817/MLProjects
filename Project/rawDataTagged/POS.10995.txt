I/PRP had/VB seen/VB this/DT film/NN many/JJ years/NN ago/RB and/CC it/PRP had/VB made/VB a/DT lasting/JJ impression/NN on/RP me./RP Alas,/NN I/PRP have/VB hardened/VB to/TO many/JJ films/NN over/IN the/DT years/NN and/CC did/VB not/RB expect/VB to/TO be/VB impressed/VB by/IN 'Kalifornia'/NN upon/IN watching/VB again/RB recently./VB I/PRP am/VB pleased/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VB every/DT bit/NN as/IN unnerving/VB and/CC watchable/NN as/IN it/PRP was/VB ten/NN or/CC so/RB years/NN ago.<br/IN /><br/DT />There/NN are/VB two/CD things/NN which/WH really/RB give/VB this/DT movie/NN its/PRP$ power./NN The/DT first/JJ is/VB its/PRP$ cast./NN We/PRP have/VB a/DT staggeringly/JJ disturbing/JJ turn/NN by/IN a/DT young/JJ Brad/NN Pitt/NN as/IN Early/RB Grace./NN Knowing/NN Pitt,/NN as/IN we/PRP all/DT do,/NN as/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT most/JJ enduring/JJ heart-throbs/NN Hollywood/NN has/VB ever/RB had,/VB it/PRP is/VB refreshing/JJ to/TO see/VB him/PRP play/VB such/PDT a/DT vile,/JJ unattractive/JJ character./RP Pitt/NN pulls/VB the/DT show/VB off/RP without/IN resorting/NN to/TO white-trash/VB clich√©/NN or/CC parody,/NN and/CC manages/VB to/TO remain/VB genuinely/DT terrifying/NN throughout/IN the/DT movie.<br/NN /><br/IN />Juliette/DT Lewis/NN is/VB equally/RB impressive/JJ as/RB Grace's/NN tragic/NN girlfriend,/NN playing/VB the/DT character/NN like/IN a/DT ten/NN year/NN old/JJ girl/NN with/IN a/DT forty/NN year/NN old's/NN life/NN experience./NN Lewis/NN manages/VB to/TO evoke/VB pity/TO (for/VB her/PRP$ character's/NN station/NN in/IN life)/NN as/IN well/RB as/IN contempt/NN (for/IN her/PRP$ naivety),/NN but/CC she/PRP underpins/VB her/PRP$ performance/NN with/IN the/DT kind/NN of/IN subtlety/NN rarely/RB seen/VB by/IN an/DT actor/NN so/RB young./RP Personally,/NN I/PRP think/VB it's/IN a/DT tragedy/NN that/IN neither/RB Pitt/NN nor/CC Lewis/NN were/VB nominated/VB for/IN any/DT awards/NN for/IN their/PRP$ performances/NN here.<br/NN /><br/VB />David/RP Duchovony/NN and/CC Michelle/NN Forbes/NN are/VB both/DT perfectly/RB cast/VB as/IN the/DT yuppy/NN couple/NN who/WH unwittingly/MD end/VB up/RP travelling/NN across/IN the/DT US/NN with/RP Pitt/NN and/CC Lewis./NN Duchovony/NN is/VB aptly/RB geeky/. and/CC naive,/NN and/CC Forbes/NN seems/VB emphatically/RB cynical/JJ and/CC shut-off,/NN but/CC both/DT actors/NN manage/VB to/TO convincingly/VB portray/VB their/PRP$ characters'/NN changes/NN as/IN they/PRP are/VB equally/RB intrigued,/JJ repulsed/NN and/CC strangely/NN attracted/VB to/TO Pitt.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT fine/JJ casting/NN and/CC uniformly/DT brilliant/JJ acting/NN aside,/IN this/DT film/NN really/RB grabs/NN us/PRP by/IN the/DT proverbial/NN balls/NN through/IN its/PRP$ flawless/JJ pacing./NN At/IN the/DT time/NN 'Kalifornia'/NN was/VB released,/DT Hollywood/NN was/VB releasing/VB a/DT slew/NN of/IN nice-character-turns-out-to-be-psychotic/DT movies/NN ('Single/IN White/JJ Female',/NN 'Pacific/RP Heights',/NN 'The/RP Hand/NN That/WH Rocks/NN The/DT Cradle',/NN 'Deceived',/NN 'Sleeping/NN With/IN The/DT Enemy'/NN etc)./IN Most/JJ of/IN these/DT movies/NN followed/VB the/DT same/JJ formula,/IN the/DT only/JJ variation/NN being/VB the/DT nature/NN of/IN the/DT relationship/NN between/IN good/JJ guy/NN and/CC bad/JJ guy./NN 'Kalifornia'/NN doesn't/VB really/RB stray/VB too/RB far/RB from/IN this/DT territory,/NN but/CC its/PRP$ first/JJ two/CD acts/NN are/VB the/DT perfect/JJ example/NN of/IN the/DT slow-boil/NN thriller,/. and/CC we/PRP are/VB kept/VB on/IN the/DT very/JJ edge/NN of/IN our/PRP$ seats/NN waiting/VB for/IN the/DT tide/NN to/TO turn.<br/VB /><br/NN />When/IN the/DT penny/NN does/VB drop,/NN and/CC Pitt/NN is/VB let/VB loose/JJ to/TO play/VB the/DT maniacal/JJ bad/JJ guy,/IN the/DT film/NN shifts/NN gears/VB completely/RB and/CC the/DT last/JJ twenty/CD minutes/NN don't/VB quite/RB live/VB up/RP to/TO rest/NN of/IN the/DT movie./NN That/WH said,/VB the/DT action/NN is/VB thick/JJ and/CC fast/JJ and/CC the/DT resolution/NN is/VB suitable/JJ cold./IN The/DT fight/NN is/VB over,/NN but/CC the/DT scars/NN will/MD always/RB be/VB there.<br/IN /><br/DT />Much/NN of/IN the/DT narration/NN (provided/NN by/IN a/DT somewhat/RB whiny,/VB pre/RP X-files/NN Duchovony)/NN is/VB a/DT tad/NN contrived./NN Of/IN course,/DT it's/NN meant/VB to/TO be/VB from/IN the/DT book/NN the/DT Duchovony's/NN journalist/NN character/NN has/VB written,/VB so/RB one/PRP could/MD argue/VB that/IN the/DT self-conscious/JJ narration/NN is/VB meant/VB to/TO be/VB a/DT nod/NN to/TO the/DT kind/NN of/IN sensationalised/DT style/NN in/IN which/WH most/JJ journalists/NN write.<br/IN /><br/DT />The/NN film/NN is/VB largely/RB a/DT success/NN and/CC is/VB certainly/RB a/DT cut/NN above/IN 90%/NN of/IN the/DT thrillers/NN of/IN the/DT past/JJ twenty/CD years./NN Highly/NN recommended,/. but/CC not/RB for/IN the/DT weak/JJ of/IN stomach/NN or/CC mind./VB This/DT film/NN is/VB disturbing/JJ on/IN more/JJ than/IN one/CD level./NN But/CC then,/NN it's/NN meant/VB to/TO be./VB
