Brian,/NN the/DT writer,/NN will/MD write/VB the/DT book,/RP Carrie/NN can/MD take/VB the/DT pictures.<br/NN /><br/IN />Being/DT artistic/JJ types,/NN Brian/NN and/CC Carrie/NN are/VB not/RB quite/RB financially/RB prepared/VB for/IN such/PDT a/DT trip,/NN so/IN they/PRP put/VB out/RP an/DT ad/NN for/IN someone/NN to/TO share/NN gas/NN and/CC travel/NN expenses,/. and/CC are/VB contacted/VB by/IN

with/IN one/CD stone,/. you/PRP know.<br/VB /><br/IN />The/DT movie/NN has/VB a/DT curious/JJ ability/NN to/TO portray/VB two/CD stereotypes,/IN the/DT artsy/JJ yuppies/NN and/CC the/DT greasy/NN
