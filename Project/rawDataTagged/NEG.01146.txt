Anyone/NN who/WH visited/VB drive-ins/NN in/IN the/DT 1950s,/NN 60s,/. and/CC 70s,/NN must/MD have/VB seen/VB a/DT film/NN or/CC two/CD by/IN American/JJ International/JJ Pictures,/NN a/DT

Milius/NN ('Magnum/RP Force')/NN but/CC certainly/RB left/VB room/NN for/IN improvement/NN in/IN his/PRP$ extensive/JJ career.<br/NN /><br/VB />The/RP 109-minute/CD 'Dillinger'/NN -/. epic/VB for/RP AIP's/NN scope/NN -/. follows/VB the/DT quest/NN of/IN FBI/NN Midwest/NN chief/NN Melvin/NN Purvis,/NN played/VB by/IN Academy/NN Award/NN winner/NN Ben/NN Johnson./NN Purvis/NN was/VB the/DT investigator/NN who/WH sought/VB revenge/NN for/IN four/CD FBI/NN agents/NN killed/VB in/IN a/DT 1933/CD Kansas/NN City/NN ambush/. that/WH helped/VB gangster/DT Frank/NN Nash/NN to/TO escape/VB

chase/NN film,/VB with/RP Purvis's/NN entourage/NN looking/VB to/TO run/VB down/RP and/CC kill/VB off/RP the/DT men/NN wanted/VB by/IN J./NN Edgar/NN Hoover.<br/NN /><br/NN />'Dillinger'/NN has/VB a/DT documentary/NN feel,/NN listing/NN dates/NN and/CC places/NN while/IN Johnson/NN supplies/VB loose/JJ narrative/NN as/RB Purvis./NN Milius/NN keeps/VB an/DT honest/JJ Depression/NN look,/NN using/VB authentic/IN fashion,/DT cars,/NN weapons,/. and/CC buildings;/VB he/PRP also/RB sprinkles/VB around/IN black-and-white/JJ photography/NN and/CC stock/NN footage/NN of/IN gangster/NN shootouts./IN The/DT film/NN is/VB never/RB boring,/VB moving/VB at/IN a/DT quick,/NN if/IN haphazard,/NN pace./IN The/DT action/NN scenes/NN are/VB Dillinger's/NN strongpoint,/IN edited/DT competently/NN by/IN Fred/NN Feitshans/NN Jr/NN in/IN his/PRP$ last/JJ professional/JJ effort./NN Thousands/NN of/IN blank/JJ ammunition/NN rounds/NN must/MD have/VB been/VB used/VB to/TO make/VB this/DT film,/NN not/RB to/TO mention/VB pounds/NN of/IN explosives./IN This/DT film/NN is/VB certainly/RB not/RB for/IN the/DT squeamish,/NN with/IN people/NN getting/VB shot/NN and/CC dropping/VB dead/JJ all/RB over/IN the/DT place./NN The/DT violence,/NN while/IN gratuitous,/NN brings/VB some/DT understanding/NN of/IN the/DT mayhem/NN that/IN organized/JJ crime/NN dumped/VB on/IN American/JJ life.<br/NN /><br/IN />This/DT film/NN never/RB transcends/VB its/PRP$ exploitation/NN status,/NN however,/NN because/IN the/DT needed/VB writing/VB just/RB isn't/VB there./DT John/NN Milius,/NN somewhat/RB overrated/VB as/IN a/DT filmmaker,/NN places/NN way/NN too/RB much/JJ emphasis/NN on/IN action./IN The/DT action/NN scenes/NN (mostly/IN blood-filled/JJ shootouts)/NN are/VB impressive/JJ and/CC comparable/JJ with/IN any/DT major/JJ crime/NN film/NN of/IN its/PRP$ era,/NN including/VB 1967's/DT 'Bonnie/NN and/CC Clyde.'/NN But/CC we/PRP simply/RB don't/VB get/VB to/TO know/VB much/RB about/RP Dillinger/NN and/CC his/PRP$ gang/NN members/NN as/IN people;/IN the/DT vital/JJ relationship/NN that/WH develops/VB between/IN Dillinger/NN and/CC Frechette/NN is/VB barely/RB touched/VB upon,/NN with/IN the/DT pair/NN meeting/NN in/IN a/DT bar/NN during/IN one/CD scene/NN and/CC cavorting/NN as/IN lovers/NN just/RB ten/JJ minutes/NN afterward./NN Melvin/NN Purvis/NN also/RB seems/VB to/TO wander/VB in/IN and/CC out/RB of/IN the/DT storyline,/NN becoming/VB a/DT prominent/JJ figure/NN only/RB when/WH Milius/NN needs/VB to/TO keep/VB the/DT film/NN from/IN unraveling./IN All/DT too/RB often,/VB the/DT film/NN takes/VB on/IN a/DT shoot-'em-up/NN persona/NN when/WH its/PRP$ characters/NN could/MD have/VB been/VB explored/NN in/IN detail.<br/DT /><br/NN />Aside/NN from/IN this,/IN the/DT picture's/JJ main/JJ crime/NN is/VB ignorance/NN of/IN historical/JJ fact./NN While/IN many/JJ say/VB that/IN 'Dillinger'/NN is/VB just/RB a/DT film,/NN it's/NN films/NN such/JJ as/IN this/DT one/NN that/WH create/VB fables/NN and/CC make/VB them/PRP permanent./VB Those/DT with/IN knowledge/NN of/IN gangster/DT history/NN will/MD point/VB out/RP that/IN John/NN Dillinger/NN was/VB not/RB the/DT last/JJ of/IN his/PRP$ ring/NN to/TO die,/VB as/RB Milius's/NN screenplay/NN and/CC the/DT film's/NN documentary/NN style/NN encourage/VB us/PRP to/TO believe./VB In/RB fact,/RP Dillinger/NN died/VB before/IN Baby/NN Face/NN Nelson/NN and/CC Homer/NN Van/NN Meter;/NN he/PRP also/RB was/VB said/VB not/RB to/TO be/VB carrying/VB a/DT gun/NN on/IN the/DT night/NN of/IN his/PRP$

couldn't/NN have/VB stayed/VB with/IN the/DT facts/NN and/CC written/VB a/DT great/JJ story/NN around/IN them.<br/NN /><br/VB />Warren/RP Oates's/NN performance/NN as/RB Dillinger/NN is/VB quite/RB good,/VB although/IN he/PRP sometimes/RB looks/VB unconvincing./RP Oates/NN is/VB humorous/NN and/CC nicely/RB portrays/VB how/WH Dillinger/NN became/VB consumed/VB by/IN his/PRP$ larger-than-life/NN image/NN in/IN the/DT American/JJ press;/NN however,/. we/PRP never/RB really/RB feel/VB the/DT menace/NN he/PRP invoked/VB in/IN his/PRP$ lifetime./NN Ben/NN Johnson/NN gives/VB some/DT life/NN to/TO Purvis,/NN suave/. but/CC rather/RB flat./JJ Michelle/NN Phillips/NN brings/VB emotion/NN to/TO the/DT Billie/NN Frechette/NN character/NN and/CC it's/VB really/RB too/RB bad/JJ that/WH Milius's/NN screenplay/NN didn't/NN flesh/NN out/IN her/PRP$ relationship/NN with/RP Dillinger./NN We/PRP never/RB learn/VB what/WH drew/VB her/PRP to/TO a/DT cold-blooded/NN killer,/IN other/JJ than/IN the/DT
