to/TO say/VB that/WH Disappearance/NN is/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT most/JJ frustrating/JJ films/NN I/PRP have/VB ever/RB watched./VB For/IN the/DT first/JJ 85/CD minutes/NN it/PRP was/VB a/DT pretty/RB

ending/VB contradicts/VB much/RB of/IN what/WH has/VB gone/VB before/RB &/CC leaves/VB the/DT viewer/NN with/IN more/JJ questions/NN than/RB answers./RP It's/NN almost/RB as/RB if/IN the/DT makers/NN

the/DT thing/NN for/IN nearly/RB an/DT hour/NN &/CC a/DT half/NN leaves/VB you/PRP confused/JJ &/CC wanting/VB to/TO know/VB more./NN Despite/IN being/VB a/DT horror/NN film/NN there's/IN no/DT

remake/NN for/IN large/JJ parts/NN as/IN that/WH is/VB what/WH the/DT film/NN is/VB set-up/VB to/TO be/VB before/IN a/DT bizarre/JJ ending/NN which/WH does/VB nothing/NN to/TO bring/VB any/DT closure/NN to/TO the/DT film.<br/NN /><br/NN />Technically/IN the/DT film/NN is/VB good/JJ with/IN high/JJ production/NN values,/IN good/JJ special/JJ effects,/NN sets,/NN locations/NN &/CC
