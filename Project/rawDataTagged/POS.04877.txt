This/DT was/VB basically/RB an/DT attempt/NN to/TO do/VB the/DT same/JJ thing/NN with/IN "Batman"/NN that/WH was/VB done/VB with/RP "Gilligan's/RP Island"/NN in/RP "Surviving/RP Gilligan's/NN

the/DT same./RP What's/NN missing/VB is/VB the/DT straightforward/JJ approach/NN that/IN "Surviving"/DT took.<br/NN /><br/IN />In/DT "Return",/NN Adam/NN West/NN and/CC Burt/NN Ward/NN both/CC receive/VB invitations/NN to/TO a/DT car/NN show/VB to/TO which/WH they/PRP were/VB not/RB meant/VB to/TO be/VB invited./NN After/IN being/VB allowed/VB to/TO stay,/VB Adam/NN and/CC Burt/NN

"Surviving",/DT "Return"/NN forces/NN the/DT viewer/NN to/TO follow/VB a/DT less/JJ interesting/JJ storyline/NN (the/NN theft/NN of/IN the/DT Batmobile)/NN instead/RB of/IN focusing/VB all/PDT

but/CC captures/NN none/NN of/IN the/DT late/RB Gorshin's/NN charm,/VB only/RB his/PRP$ characterizations./JJ Other/JJ actors'/NN portrayals/NN are/VB short/JJ and/CC functional,/NN with/IN none/NN standing/VB out/RP as/IN especially/RB good/JJ or/CC bad./DT Many/JJ of/IN the/DT stories/NN have/VB been/VB told/VB before,/NN but/CC they/PRP mostly/RB play/VB out/RP amusingly,/NN with/IN only/RB the/DT occasional/JJ clunky/NN presentation./IN Another/DT wonderful/JJ bit/NN from/IN the/DT historical/JJ sections/NN was/VB the/DT use/NN of/IN audition/VB footage/NN of/RP Lyle/NN Waggoner's/NN tryout/NN for/IN the/DT part/NN of/RP Batman./NN The/DT only/JJ place/NN where/WH the/DT flashbacks/NN fail/VB is/VB when/WH they/PRP insert/NN obviously/RB made/VB up/RP plot/NN points/NN to/TO advance/VB the/DT main/JJ story./IN This/DT downgrades/NN the/DT accuracy/NN of/IN the/DT flashbacks/NN needlessly.<br/IN /><br/DT />The/NN "main/NN plot"/NN (if/. that/WH is/VB what/WH we/PRP must/MD call/VB it)/DT is,/NN of/IN course,/NN ludicrous./IN This/DT is/VB not/RB really/RB a/DT fault/NN in/IN and/CC of/IN itself,/NN but/CC it's/VB just/RB not/RB carried/VB off/RP well/RB enough/RB to/TO

we/PRP really/RB get/VB neither,/NN here./IN The/DT performances/NN by/IN West/NN and/CC Ward/NN seem/VB somewhat/RB flat/JJ (even/NN for/IN them);/IN the/DT dialog/NN too/RB carefully/RB written/VB for/IN it/PRP to/TO feel/VB natural./RP Again,/NN I/PRP think/VB the/DT comparison/NN to/TO "Surviving/PRP$ Gilligan's/NN Island"/NN can/MD be/VB seen/VB in/IN that/IN the/DT dialog/NN is/VB mostly/RB just/RB there/RB to/TO set/VB up/RP a/DT flashback./NN In/IN "Surviving",/NN that's/IN all/DT it/PRP intends/VB to/TO be./VB In/IN "Return"/VB it/PRP tries/VB to/TO do/VB double/JJ duty/NN and,/NN

is/VB about/IN the/DT "Batman"/NN TV/NN series/NN and/CC its/PRP$ history,/NN yet/RB all/PDT the/DT clips/NN shown/VB are/VB from/IN the/DT theatrical/JJ movie./NN Even/RB the/DT Waggoner/NN

made/VB first,/VB only/RB to/TO be/VB delayed/VB in/IN favor/NN of/IN the/DT TV/NN show/NN when/WH CBS/NN needed/VB to/TO fill/VB time/NN fast./VB So/RB when/WH Waggoner/NN and/CC West/NN were/VB
