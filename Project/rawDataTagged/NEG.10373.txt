I/PRP picked/VB this/DT title/NN up/RB from/IN a/DT friend/NN who/WH had/VB it/PRP sitting/VB in/IN his/PRP$ exhaustive/JJ DVD/Video/Laserdisc/NN collection,/VB so/RB luckily/VB I/PRP didn't/VB personally/RB have/VB to/TO pay/VB for/IN it./VB I/PRP had/VB an/DT inkling/NN that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT bad/JJ film,/NN but/CC I/PRP KNOW/NN what/WH a/DT truly/RB bad/JJ film/NN is/VB after/IN watching/VB greats/NN like/IN Children/NN Shouldn't/NN Play/NN With/IN Dead/NN Things/NN and/CC The/DT Incredibly/NN Strange/NN Creatures/NN Who/WH Stopped/NN Living/VB and/CC Became/NN Mixed-Up/NN Zombies,/NN and/CC now/RB there/EX is/VB truly/RB nothing/NN that/WH fazes/VB me/PRP unless/IN it/PRP is/VB astoundingly/DT bad.<br/NN /><br/VB />Solar/RP Crisis/NN is/VB bad,/NN but/CC it/PRP doesn't/MD reach/VB that/IN sweet/JJ spot/NN of/IN absolute/JJ pain/NN that/IN some/DT movies/NN are/VB at.<br/DT /><br/NN />Anyway,/IN the/DT general/JJ plot/NN is/VB that/IN the/DT sun/NN is/VB about/RB to/TO unleash/VB a/DT huge/JJ solar/JJ flare/NN towards/IN the/DT earth/NN that/WH will/MD essentially/RB destroy/VB it./NN In/IN order/NN to/TO counter-act/VB this/DT imminent/JJ threat,/NN humanity/NN has/VB assembled/VB a/DT spaceship/NN and/CC crew/NN whose/WH$ duty/NN it/PRP is/VB to/TO fire/VB an/DT antimatter/NN bomb/NN (which/IN the/DT opening/NN describes/VB as/IN "the/DT biggest/JJ explosive/JJ ever")/NN into/IN the/DT sun,/NN which/WH through/IN some/DT convoluted/JJ sci-fi/NN logic/NN will/MD cause/VB the/DT flare/NN to/TO shoot/VB out/RP at/IN a/DT different/JJ angle,/NN leaving/VB earth/NN unharmed.<br/IN /><br/DT />Never/NN mind/NN that/IN what/WH I/PRP have/VB just/RB described/VB to/TO you/PRP sounds/VB like/IN a/DT bad/JJ episode/NN of/IN the/DT original/JJ Star/JJ Trek./NN Even/RB with/IN an/DT ensemble/NN cast/VB (Charlton/RP Heston,/NN Peter/NN Boyle,/NN and/CC Jack/NN Palance),/NN Solar/NN Crisis/NN can/MD barely/RB manage/VB that/IN level/NN of/IN mediocrity,/DT thanks/NN to/TO a/DT plot/NN that/WH starts/VB simple,/VB yet/RB becomes/VB increasingly/RB nonsensical/VB as/IN time/NN wears/VB on.<br/DT /><br/NN />The/IN crowning/DT achievement/NN of/IN this/DT debacle/NN of/IN a/DT movie/NN is/VB the/DT addition/NN of/IN a/DT villain/NN character/NN (played/VB by/RP Boyle)/NN who/WH insists/VB on/RP sabotaging/IN the/DT mission./NN Through/IN means/NN that/WH are/VB never/RB explained,/VB he/PRP sends/VB an/DT evil/JJ minion/NN with/IN an/DT embarrassingly/JJ bad/JJ haircut/NN to/TO exercise/VB some/DT sort/NN of/IN vague/JJ electronic/JJ mind/NN control/NN over/IN the/DT space/NN crew's/VB genetically/RB engineered/VB scientist,/TO played/VB by/IN female/NN lead/VB Annabel/NN Schofield./NN Why/WH is/VB he/PRP sabotaging/VB the/DT mission?/NN Because/IN by/IN his/PRP$ moronic/NN viewpoint,/. he/PRP believes/VB the/DT flare/NN won't/NN happen/VB and/CC that/IN when/WH it/PRP doesn't,/VB he/PRP will/MD become/VB fabulously/DT wealthy/JJ because/IN he/PRP has/VB dug/VB his/PRP$ evil/JJ claws/NN into/IN the/DT stock/NN market./NN In/IN effect,/VB you/PRP have/VB a/DT villain/NN with/IN the/DT most/JJ absurdly/NN stupid/JJ motivation/NN imaginable.<br/IN /><br/DT />The/NN film's/NN plot/NN becomes/VB amazingly/DT convoluted/JJ and/CC develops/VB very/RB slowly,/VB in/IN time/NN tapping/VB the/DT use/NN of/IN characters/NN who/WH have/VB only/RB vague/JJ or/CC uselessly/DT brief/JJ roles/NN in/IN the/DT storyline./NN I/PRP could/MD sit/VB here/RB and/CC explain/VB in/IN detail/NN precisely/RB what/WH happens/VB to/TO demonstrate/VB the/DT sheer/JJ inability/NN of/IN the/DT screenwriter/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT plot/NN that/IN actually/RB clicks/. or/CC holds/VB your/PRP$ attention,/NN but/CC I/PRP am/VB sitting/VB here/RB writing/VB this/DT review/NN on/IN Microsoft/NN Word/NN and/CC I/PRP know/VB for/IN a/DT fact/NN that/IN this/DT would/MD take/VB three/CD pages,/NN and/CC I/PRP would/MD only/RB succeed/VB in/IN losing/VB your/PRP$ interest./NN But/CC then/RB again,/VB you/PRP would/MD probably/RB get/VB the/DT same/JJ effect/NN from/IN watching/VB the/DT film.<br/NN /><br/NN />Anyway,/IN the/DT film/NN is/VB miserably/TO bogged/VB down/RP with/IN exceedingly/DT poor/JJ dialogue./NN Imagine/VB if/IN all/PDT that/DT ever/RB happened/VB on/IN the/DT Star/NN Trek/NN Enterprise/NN was/VB that/IN the/DT characters/NN spewed/VB sci-fi/DT jargon/NN back/RB and/CC forth/RB at/RP each-other./RP Yes,/NN I/PRP know,/VB they/PRP already/RB do/VB that,/NN but/CC imagine/VB if/IN that's/TO ALL/NN they/PRP did,/VB and/CC that/WH they/PRP used/VB said/VB jargon/NN to/TO set/VB up/RP vague/JJ and/CC near-nonsensical/NN scenes/NN that/WH produce/VB no/DT excitement,/NN tension,/. or/CC interest/NN in/IN the/DT viewer/NN whatsoever.<br/IN /><br/DT />This/NN is/VB best/JJ exemplified/NN at/IN the/DT point/NN when/WH a/DT character/NN in/IN a/FW Zero-G/NN environment/NN screws/IN a/DT bolt/NN back/RB onto/IN a/DT metal/NN box/NN before/IN proceeding/NN to/TO cry/NN in/IN agony/NN for/IN a/DT couple/NN of/IN minutes/NN before/IN suddenly/RB exploding./VB The/DT script/NN alludes/VB previously/RB to/TO the/DT character/NN risking/VB an/DT explosion,/NN but/CC doesn't/NN bother/VB to/TO give/VB any/DT solid/JJ answer/NN as/IN to/TO why/WH or/CC how/WH this/DT occurs,/NN nor/CC why/WH he/PRP can't/VB really/RB escape./VB In/IN totality,/VB you/PRP have/VB a/DT sorry/JJ cross/NN between/IN the/DT bizarre/JJ and/CC the/DT laughable.<br/NN /><br/NN />Then/. we/PRP have/VB several/JJ scenes/NN where/WH dramatic/JJ build-up/NN leads/VB to/TO nothing./VB Jack/NN Palance's/NN performance/NN is/VB wasted/NN on/IN a/DT character/NN that/WH serves/VB only/RB to/TO drive/VB the/DT boy/NN hero/NN (don't/NN ask)/NN around/IN the/DT desert,/NN before/IN getting/VB roughed/VB up/RP and/CC killed/VB by/IN a/DT bunch/NN of/IN suits./NN On/IN his/PRP$ death-bed,/FW Palance/NN finally/RB tells/VB our/PRP$ boy/NN hero/NN his/PRP$ last/JJ name/NN (while/NN wearing/VB a/DT horrible/JJ bruised/NN makeup/NN job/NN that/WH makes/VB it/PRP look/VB like/IN somebody/NN put/VB a/DT balloon/NN under/IN his/PRP$ eyeball),/NN which/WH he/PRP kept/VB quiet/JJ about/IN before./DT Colonel/NN Travis/NN J./NN Richards./NN The/DT boy/NN repeats/VB it/PRP quietly/RB after/IN he/PRP expires,/MD giving/VB viewers/NN the/DT impression/NN that/IN the/DT name/NN is/VB of/IN some/DT significance/NN later/RB on/IN in/IN the/DT film./NN Perhaps/RB Charlton/NN Heston's/NN grizzled/IN admiral/DT character/NN knows/VB him/PRP and/CC the/DT plot/NN will/MD advance/VB thereby/RB once/IN his/PRP$ name/NN is/VB repeated./RP Something./NN Anything.<br/NN /><br/VB />Nope./RP Sorry./NN Any/DT hopes/VB you/PRP have/VB will/MD be/VB dashed/VB when/WH this/DT moment/NN turns/VB out/RP only/RB to/TO be/VB another/DT of/IN many/JJ pathetic,/NN failed/VB attempts/NN at/IN creating/VB dramaÂ—for/IN a/DT character/NN so/RB flat/JJ and/CC hackneyed/NN that/IN it/PRP will/MD forever/RB be/VB a/DT stain/VB on/RP Palance's/NN career,/VB just/RB as/IN those/DT of/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT cast/NN are/VB similarly/RB marred.<br/JJ /><br/NN />Completing/IN the/DT film/NN is/VB a/DT painfully/RB abrupt/JJ ending/NN featuring/VB Schofield/NN piloting/IN the/DT bomb/NN into/IN the/DT center/NN of/IN the/DT sun/NN in/IN an/DT effort/NN to/TO redeem/VB her/PRP$ deeds/NN while/IN under/IN the/DT villain's/NN spell,/IN a/DT climax/NN which/WH features/VB another/DT of/IN the/DT film's/NN considerably/RB well-done/VB visual/JJ effects/NN sequences/NN that,/VB even/RB for/IN the/DT visibly/RB elaborate/JJ care/NN put/VB into/IN them,/NN still/RB always/RB manage/VB to/TO make/VB the/DT film/NN look/VB just/RB as/IN chintzy/NN as/IN it/PRP really/RB is./VB The/DT saddest/NN part/NN about/IN this/DT film/NN is/VB the/DT obviously/RB large/JJ budget,/NN tragically/NN wasted/NN on/IN a/DT stinker/NN of/IN a/DT script/NN and/CC a/DT supporting/VB cast/VB behind/RP Boyle,/NN Heston,/NN and/CC Palance/NN that/WH manage/VB to/TO nail/VB the/DT
