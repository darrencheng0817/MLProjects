The/DT problem/NN with/RP "The/RP Killer/NN Elite"/NN is/VB that/IN just/RB by/IN seeking/VB this/DT film/NN out,/. and/CC investing/NN time/NN to/TO watch/VB it,/IN you/PRP are/VB putting/VB more/JJ effort/NN into/IN the/DT experience/NN than/IN many/JJ of/IN its/PRP$ principals/NN did,/VB particularly/RB director/NN Sam/NN Peckinpah.<br/NN /><br/NN />The/VB already/RB volatile/JJ Peckinpah/NN was/VB heading/VB into/IN rough/JJ weather/NN with/IN this/DT film./NN According/VB to/TO at/IN least/JJ one/CD biographer,/IN this/DT was/VB where/WH he/PRP became/VB acquainted/NN with/IN cocaine./NN Add/VB to/TO that/IN his/PRP$ binge/NN drinking,/. and/CC it's/VB no/RB wonder/VB things/NN fell/VB apart.<br/DT /><br/NN />It's/IN a/DT shame,/NN because/IN the/DT concept/NN behind/IN the/DT film/NN is/VB a/DT good/JJ one,/NN and/CC the/DT first/JJ ten/NN minutes/NN promise/NN much./NN Mike/NN Locken/NN (James/RP Caan)/NN and/CC George/NN Hansen/NN (Robert/RP Duvall)/NN are/VB private/JJ contractors/NN who/WH do/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN dirty/JJ work/NN for/IN the/DT CIA./NN They/PRP move/VB quick,/DT live/JJ well,/NN and/CC seem/VB like/IN the/DT best/JJ of/IN friends/NN -/. then/RB something/NN happens/VB to/TO shatter/VB their/PRP$ brotherhood.<br/NN /><br/IN />An/DT opening/NN scene/NN shows/VB them/PRP blowing/VB up/RP a/DT building/NN -/. why/WH exactly/RB we/PRP aren't/VB told,/DT par/NN for/IN the/DT course/NN in/IN terms/NN of/IN this/DT film's/JJ murky/JJ motivation./NN But/CC the/DT implication/NN is/VB these/DT guys/NN hurt/VB people/NN and/CC don't/VB really/RB care/VB -/. antiheroes/VB much/RB like/IN the/DT Wild/NN Bunch/NN of/RP Peckinpah's/NN not-so-long-ago./IN An/DT opening/NN title/NN tells/VB us/PRP they/PRP work/VB for/RP ComTeg,/NN then/RB adds/VB with/IN obvious/JJ tongue/NN in/IN cheek/DT "...the/NN thought/VB the/DT CIA/NN might/MD employ/VB such/PDT an/DT organization/NN for/IN any/DT purpose/NN is,/NN of/IN course,/VB preposterous."/RP That's/NN a/DT pretty/RB clever/JJ way/NN of/IN letting/VB the/DT audience/NN know/VB all/DT bets/NN are/VB off.<br/IN /><br/DT />Add/NN to/TO that/IN a/DT traditionally/RB strong/RB Peckinpah/NN backup/NN cast,/NN including/VB Burt/NN Young,/NN Gig/NN Young,/NN and/CC Peckinpah/NN regular/JJ Bo/NN Hopkins/NN in/IN the/DT plum/NN role/NN of/IN a/DT madman/NN who/WH can't/MD pass/VB up/RP an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO be/VB shot/VB at/IN for/IN $500/IN a/DT day,/NN and/CC you/PRP only/RB wish/VB that/IN the/DT scriptwriters,/NN including/VB the/DT celebrated/JJ Sterling/NN Silliphant,/NN tried/VB to/TO do/VB something/NN more/RB with/IN the/DT story/NN than/IN turn/VB it/PRP into/IN a/DT platform/NN for/IN lazy/JJ one-liners/NN and/CC bad/JJ chop-socky/NN knockoffs./IN An/DT attempt/NN at/IN injecting/VB a/DT dose/NN of/IN liberal/JJ social/JJ commentary/NN is/VB awkwardly/TO shoehorned/VB in./TO "You're/VB so/RB busy/JJ doing/VB their/PRP$ dirty/JJ work,/. you/PRP

Peckinpah's/NN clumsy/JJ direction/NN and/CC sluggish/JJ pacing./RP We're/NN 40/CD minutes/NN into/IN the/DT film/NN before/IN we/PRP get/VB our/PRP$ first/JJ battle/NN scene,/IN a/DT completely/RB chaotic/JJ collection/NN of/IN random/JJ shots/NN where/WH a/DT bunch/NN of/IN people/NN we/PRP haven't/VB even/RB met/VB before/RB are/VB seen/VB fighting/VB at/IN San/NN Francisco/NN Airport,/NN their/PRP$ battle/NN intercut/NN with/IN a/DT conversation/NN in/IN an/DT office/NN suite.<br/NN /><br/NN />By/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT film,/NN what's/NN left/VB of/IN the/DT cast/NN is/VB having/VB a/DT battle/NN inside/IN a/DT fleet/NN of/RB mothballed/RP Victory/NN Ships,/NN ninjas/NN running/VB out/RP in/IN the/DT open/JJ to/TO be/VB gunned/VB down/RP while/IN Caan/NN tosses/VB

like/IN when/WH Locken,/NN recovering/VB from/IN some/DT nasty/JJ injuries,/NN is/VB told/VB by/IN one/CD of/IN his/PRP$ bosses,/NN played/VB by/IN a/DT smooth/JJ Arthur/NN Hill,/NN that/IN he's/NN
