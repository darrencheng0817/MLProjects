After/IN seeing/VB MIDNIGHT/NN OFFERINGS/NN I/PRP am/VB still/RB convinced/VB that/IN the/DT first/JJ decent/JJ movie/NN about/IN (teenage)/DT witches/NN yet/RB has/VB to/TO be/VB made./IN I/PRP didn't/MD think/VB much/RB of/IN THE/DT CRAFT/NN and/CC I'm/NN not/RB into/IN CHARMED/NN either./IN The/DT only/JJ film/NN I/PRP more/RB or/CC less/RB enjoyed/VB (about/IN teenage/DT witches)/NN was/VB LITTLE/NN WITCHES/NN (1996),/. and/CC even/RB that/IN one/CD wasn't/NN very/RB good./.
