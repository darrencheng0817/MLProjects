After/IN seeing/VB only/JJ half/NN of/IN the/DT film/NN in/IN school/NN back/VB in/RP November,/NN today,/. I/PRP saw/VB that/IN it/PRP was/VB on/RP Flix/NN channel/NN and/CC decided/VB to/TO watch/VB it/PRP to/TO see/VB the/DT rest/NN of/IN it/PRP and/CC to/TO write/VB a/DT new/JJ review/NN on/IN it.<br/DT /><br/NN />The/NN book/NN that/IN the/DT film/NN is/VB based/VB on,/RP Hatchet,/NN is/VB OK./NN This/DT is/VB a/DT terrible/JJ adaption/NN of/IN it/PRP though.<br/VB /><br/DT />Awful/NN (and/. I/PRP mean/VB awful)/IN acting,/DT bad/JJ dialogue,/NN and/CC average/JJ cinematography/NN make/VB up/RP this/DT terrible/JJ adaption/NN of/RP Hatchet.<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT film/NN starts/VB off/RP Brian/NN who/WH is/VB the/DT cliché/NN image/NN of/IN a/DT late/JJ 80s/NN teen/NN (sporting/IN a/DT mullet,/NN banging/IN his/PRP$ head/NN to/TO cheap/JJ 80s/NN rock/NN music)/. and/CC his/PRP$ mother/NN driving/VB in/IN a/DT car/NN for/IN him/PRP to/TO get/VB on/IN a/DT plane/NN to/TO fly/VB up/RP to/TO see/VB his/PRP$ estranged/NN Dad/NN (his/NN parents/NN are/VB divorced...now/DT cue/NN the/DT dramatic/JJ pause.)/NN Now/RB Brian/NN has/VB said/VB goodbye/VB to/TO Mom/NN and/CC dog/NN and/CC is/VB flying/VB up/RP to/TO see/VB his/PRP$ father./NN The/DT pilot/NN is/VB a/DT fat,/NN ugly,/IN rude/JJ man/NN (wasn't/NN like/IN that/DT in/IN the/DT book)/NN who/WH after/IN 2/CD minutes/NN in/IN the/DT air,/NN has/VB a/DT heart/NN attack/NN and/CC dies./NN In/IN the/DT book/NN it/PRP goes/VB into/IN more/JJ detail/NN with/IN the/DT pilot/NN having/VB more/JJ pains/NN and/CC it/PRP seemed/VB to/TO be/VB that/IN they/PRP were/VB in/IN the/DT air/NN much/RB longer/RB before/IN the/DT pilot/NN had/VB his/PRP$ heart/NN attack.<br/IN /><br/DT />The/NN plane/NN (within/IN another/DT two/CD minutes)/NN has/VB gone/VB empty/JJ on/IN fuel/NN (leaving/NN us,/IN the/DT viewers,/NN to/TO assume/VB that/IN he's/NN been/VB up/RP there/RB for/IN hours/NN even/RB though/IN the/DT sun/NN hasn't/NN changed/VB position/NN and/CC the/DT scenery/NN looks/VB EXACTLY/NN the/DT same.)/RP Now's/NN he's/NN crashed/VB landed.<br/IN /><br/DT />This/NN is/VB the/DT point/NN in/IN the/DT movie/NN where/WH everything/NN is/VB a/DT lot/NN different/JJ then/RB it/PRP was/VB in/IN the/DT book./NN In/IN the/DT book/NN it/PRP said/VB his/PRP$ jacket/NN was/VB torn/VB to/TO shreds/NN but/CC in/IN the/DT movie/NN it/PRP is/VB perfectly/RB fine/JJ with/IN no/DT tears/NN or/CC rips/NN (looks/NN like/IN he/PRP just/RB bought/VB it),/IN it/PRP never/RB said/VB he/PRP climbed/VB a/DT mountain,/NN saw/VB a/DT wolf,/NN and/CC fell/VB asleep/RB up/RB there/RB on/IN the/DT mountain,/NN it/PRP never/RB said/VB he/PRP was/VB attacked/VB by/IN a/DT bear/NN (it/NN said/VB a/DT moose/NN but/CC not/RB a/DT bear),/NN it/PRP never/RB said/VB he/PRP eats/VB the/DT several/JJ bugs/NN that/IN he/PRP does,/VB it/PRP never/RB mentions/VB the/DT second/JJ tornado/NN or/CC that/WH he/PRP learned/VB to/TO get/VB those/DT sparrows,/NN skin/NN them,/. and/CC eat/VB them/PRP or/CC that/DT little/JJ fish/NN farm/NN trap/NN that/IN he/PRP makes/VB (that/TO is/VB destroyed/VB by/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT tornadoes)/NN nor/CC does/VB it/PRP mention/VB him/PRP hurting/VB his/PRP$ ribs/NN from/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT tornadoes.<br/NN /><br/IN />I/DT don't/NN even/RB think/VB you/PRP can/MD call/VB what/WH was/VB depicted/VB in/IN the/DT film/NN a/DT tornado./NN All/RB it/PRP was/VB was/VB just/RB a/DT windstorm/NN that/WH knocked/VB down/RB several/JJ of/IN his/PRP$ things.<br/NN /><br/IN />My/DT favorite/JJ part/NN of/IN this/DT camp/NN fest/JJ was/VB Brian's/NN lame/IN flashbacks/DT (that/NN are/VB never/RB mentioned/VB in/IN the/DT book)/NN especially/RB the/DT cliché/NN scene/NN of/IN Brian/NN waking/NN up,/NN walking/VB over/RP to/TO the/DT window/NN and/CC seeing/VB his/PRP$ Dad/NN (with/IN all/DT of/IN his/PRP$ things/NN packed/VB that/WH can/MD all/RB perfectly/RB fit/VB into/IN just/RB the/DT back/RB of/IN his/PRP$ truck)/NN leaving/VB and/CC screams/NN "DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD!!!!"/NN (yet/NN of/IN course/NN his/PRP$ father/NN didn't/NN hear/VB him/PRP even/RB though/IN he/PRP was/VB just/RB right/JJ outside)/NN and/CC he/PRP punches/VB his/PRP$ fist/NN through/IN the/DT window/NN (wtf?)/IN <br/DT /><br/NN />The/NN ending/VB is/VB the/DT only/JJ thing/NN that/WH is/VB close/VB to/TO what/WH happened/VB in/IN the/DT book/NN (I/NN said/VB close.)/NN In/IN the/DT book/NN I/PRP think/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT key/JJ things/NN that/IN the/DT rescue/NN pilot/NN said/VB to/TO Brian/NN when/WH he/PRP landed/VB was/VB "you're/IN the/DT kid/NN who/WH they've/MD been/VB looking/VB for!/IN They/PRP stopped/VB months/NN ago..."/VB yet/RB they/PRP left/VB that/IN line/NN out/RP in/IN the/DT movie.<br/NN /><br/NN />There's/IN a/DT pathetic/NN epilogue/NN with/IN Brian/NN (somehow/NN without/IN counseling/NN or/CC therapy)/NN getting/VB back/RP to/TO normal/JJ with/IN his/PRP$ family./NN I/PRP think/VB we/PRP were/VB supposed/VB to/TO assume/VB that/IN they/PRP were/VB getting/VB together/RB for/RP Thanksgiving/NN (because/. they/PRP had/VB a/DT turkey/NN on/IN the/DT counter.)/NN Then/RB it/PRP shows/VB his/PRP$ temporary/JJ home/NN (for/NN what,/NN in/IN the/DT movie,/NN seemed/VB like/IN three/CD days,/NN but/CC in/IN the/DT book/NN was/VB for/IN several/JJ months)/NN and/CC his/PRP$ hatchet,/NN still/RB in/IN a/DT tree/NN where/WH he/PRP left/VB it/PRP (also/VB didn't/TO happen/VB in/IN the/DT book)/NN showing/VB where/WH he/PRP carved/VB a/DT message,/NN so/RB perfectly/RB done:/JJ "HOME"/NN (where/. we/PRP really/RB supposed/VB to/TO believe/VB that/IN he/PRP carved/VB that/IN that/WH perfectly/RB with/IN just/RB that/IN hatchet?)/DT <br/NN /><br/IN />No/DT quote/NN can/MD sum/VB this/DT movie/NN up/RB better/RB then/RB when/WH Enid/NN from/IN Ghost/NN World/NN said/VB "this/TO is/VB so/RB bad/JJ it's/NN gone/VB past/JJ good/JJ and/CC back/RB to/TO bad/JJ again."/NN Perfect/NN description/NN of/IN this/DT movie.<br/NN /><br/IN />I/DT wouldn't/NN recommend/VB it/PRP to/TO somebody/NN (who/NN hasn't/NN read/VB the/DT book)/NN and/CC are/VB just/RB looking/VB to/TO watch/VB a/DT movie/NN nor/CC would/MD I/PRP to/TO somebody/NN who/WH has/VB read/VB the/DT book/NN (because/NN they'll/NN be/VB disappointed/JJ and/CC bored/JJ to/TO death.<br/VB /><br/NN />For/IN those/DT who/WH have/VB read/VB the/DT book,/NN leave/VB what/WH your/PRP$ imagination/NN created/VB as/IN the/DT movie./NN This/DT is/VB awful/JJ and/CC will/MD bring/VB down/RP your/PRP$ thoughts/NN on/IN the/DT book.<br/NN /><br/NN />1/10/NN
