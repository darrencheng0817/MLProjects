Anyone/NN who/WH knows/VB me/PRP even/RB remotely/RB can/MD tell/VB you/PRP that/IN I/PRP love/VB bad/JJ movies/NN almost/RB as/IN much/JJ as/IN I/PRP love/VB great/JJ ones,/NN and/CC I/PRP can/MD honestly/RB say/VB that/IN I/PRP have/VB finally/RB seen/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT all-time/JJ legendary/JJ bad/JJ movies:/IN the/DT almost/RB indescribable/JJ mess/NN that/WH is/VB MYRA/NN BRECKINRIDGE./NN An/DT adaptation/NN of/IN Gore/NN Vidal's/NN best-selling/NN book/NN (he/VB later/RB disowned/VB this/DT film/NN version),/IN the/DT star-studded/RP MYRA/NN BRECKINRIDGE/NN is/VB truly/RB a/DT movie/NN so/RB bad/JJ that/IN it/PRP remains/VB bizarrely/DT entertaining/JJ from/IN beginning/VB to/TO end./VB The/DT X-rated/NN movie/NN about/IN sex/NN change/NN operations/NN and/CC Hollywood/NN was/VB an/DT absolute/JJ catastrophe/NN at/IN the/DT box/NN office/NN and/CC was/VB literally/RB booed/VB off/RP the/DT screen/NN by/IN both/DT critics/NN and/CC audiences/NN at/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN it's/DT release./NN Not/RB surprisingly,/VB the/DT film/NN went/VB on/RP to/TO gain/VB a/DT near-legendary/NN cult/NN status/NN among/IN lovers/NN of/IN bad/JJ cinema,/NN and/CC I/PRP was/VB actually/RB quite/RB excited/VB to/TO finally/RB see/VB for/IN the/DT first/JJ time.<br/NN /><br/IN />Director/DT Michael/NN Sarne/NN (who/VB only/RB had/VB two/CD other/JJ previous/JJ directing/NN credits/NN to/TO his/PRP$ name/NN at/IN the/DT time),/NN took/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN flack/NN for/IN the/DT finished/JJ film,/NN and,/NN in/IN honesty,/VB it/PRP really/RB does/VB not/RB look/VB like/IN he/PRP had/VB a/DT clue/NN about/IN what/WH he/PRP was/VB trying/VB to/TO achieve./VB The/DT film/NN is/VB often/RB incoherent,/VB with/IN entire/JJ sequences/NN edited/VB together/RB in/IN such/PDT a/DT half-hazzard/NN manner/NN that/IN many/JJ scenes/NN become/VB nearly/RB incomprehensible./VB Also/RB irritating/VB is/VB the/DT gimmick/NN of/IN using/VB archival/DT footage/NN from/IN the/DT Fox/NN film/NN vaults/NN and/CC splicing/VB it/PRP into/IN the/DT picture/NN at/IN regular/JJ intervals./IN This/DT means/NN that/IN there/EX is/VB archival/DT footage/NN of/IN past/JJ film/NN stars/VB such/JJ as/IN Judy/NN Garland/NN and/CC Shirley/NN Temple/NN laced/NN into/IN newly-film/DT scenes/NN of/IN often/RB lewd/VB sexual/JJ acts,/NN and/CC the/DT process/NN just/RB doesn't/VB work/VB as/RB intended/VB (this/VB also/RB caused/VB a/DT minor/JJ uproar,/NN as/IN actors/NN such/JJ as/RB Temple/NN and/CC Loretta/NN Young/NN sued/VB the/DT studio/NN for/IN using/VB their/PRP$ image/NN without/IN permission).<br/NN /><br/VB />Perhaps/RP Sarne/NN is/VB not/RB the/DT only/RB one/CD to/TO blame,/VB however,/NN as/IN the/DT film's/NN screenplay/NN and/CC casting/NN will/MD also/RB make/VB many/JJ viewers/NN shake/VB their/PRP$ heads/NN in/IN disbelief./NN For/IN instance,/IN this/DT film/NN will/MD ask/VB you/PRP to/TO believe/VB that/IN the/DT scrawny/NN film/NN critic/NN Rex/NN Reed/NN (in/IN his/PRP$ first/JJ and/CC last/JJ major/JJ film/NN role)/NN could/MD have/VB a/DT sex/NN change/NN operation/NN and/CC emerge/VB as/IN the/DT gorgeous/NN sex/NN goddess/NN Raquel/NN Welch?!/NN The/DT film/NN becomes/VB further/RB hard/JJ to/TO follow/VB when/WH Welch/NN as/RB Myra/NN attempts/NN to/TO take/VB over/IN a/DT film/NN school/NN from/IN her/PRP$ sleazy/NN uncle/NN (played/NN by/IN legendary/JJ film/NN director/NN John/NN Huston),/NN seduce/IN a/DT nubile/JJ female/JJ film/NN student/NN (Farrah/RP Fawcett),/NN and/CC teach/VB the/DT school's/NN resident/NN bad/JJ boy/NN (Roger/RP Herren)/NN a/DT lesson/NN by/IN raping/VB him/PRP with/IN a/DT strap-on/NN dildo./NN Did/VB everyone/NN follow/VB that?/IN <br/DT /><br/NN />And/. it/PRP gets/VB even/RB better/JJ (or/NN worse,/NN depending/VB upon/IN your/PRP$ perspective)!/NN I/PRP have/VB yet/RB to/TO mention/VB the/DT film's/NN top-billed/NN star:/IN the/DT legendary/JJ screen/NN sex/NN symbol/NN of/IN the/DT nineteen-thirties,/NN Mae/NN West!/NN Ms./NN West/NN was/VB 77/CD year/NN old/JJ when/WH she/PRP appeared/VB in/IN this/DT film/NN (she/NN had/VB been/VB retired/VB for/IN 26/CD years),/NN and/CC apparently/RB she/PRP still/RB considered/VB herself/PRP to/TO be/VB a/DT formidable/NN sex/NN symbol/NN as/IN she/PRP plays/VB an/DT upscale/JJ talent/NN agent/NN who/WH has/VB hunky/DT men/NN (including/IN a/DT young/JJ Tom/NN Selleck)/NN throwing/VB themselves/PRP at/IN her./NN As/IN if/IN this/DT weren't/JJ bad/JJ enough,/IN the/DT tone-deaf/NN West/NN actually/RB performs/VB two/CD newly-written/NN songs/NN about/IN halfway/NN through/IN the/DT film,/NN and/CC I/PRP think/VB that/IN I/PRP might/MD have/VB endured/VB permanent/JJ brain/NN damage/NN from/IN listening/VB to/TO them!/VB <br/IN /><br/DT />Naturally,/NN none/NN of/IN this/DT even/RB closely/RB resembles/VB anything/NN that/IN any/DT person/NN of/IN reasonable/JJ taste/NN would/MD describe/VB as/IN "good,"/NN but/CC I/PRP would/MD give/VB MYRA/NN BRECKINRIDGE/NN a/DT 4/CD out/IN of/IN 10/CD because/IN it/PRP was/VB always/RB morbidly/VB entertaining/JJ even/RB when/WH I/PRP had/VB no/DT idea/NN what/WH in/IN the/DT hell/NN was/VB supposed/VB to/TO be/VB going/VB on./RP Also,/NN most/RB of/IN the/DT cast/NN tries/VB really/RB hard./RP Raquel,/NN in/IN particular,/NN appears/VB so/RB hell-bent/JJ in/IN turning/VB her/PRP$ poorly-written/NN part/NN into/IN something/NN meaningful/JJ that/IN she/PRP single-handedly/MD succeeds/VB in/IN making/VB the/DT movie/NN worth/JJ watching./NN If/IN she/PRP had/VB only/RB been/VB working/VB with/IN a/DT decent/JJ screenplay/NN and/CC capable/JJ director/NN then/RB she/PRP might/MD have/VB finally/RB received/VB some/DT respect/NN form/NN critics.<br/IN /><br/DT />The/NN rest/NN of/IN the/DT cast/NN is/VB also/RB fine./VB The/DT endearingly/NN over-the-top/NN John/NN Huston/NN (who/VB really/RB should/MD have/VB been/VB directing/VB the/DT picture)/NN has/VB some/DT funny/JJ moments,/RP Rex/NN Reed/NN isn't/IN bad/JJ for/IN a/DT non-actor,/NN and/CC Farrah/NN Fawcett/NN is/VB pleasantly/DT fresh-faced/NN and/CC likable./NN Roger/NN Herren/NN is/VB also/RB fine,/. but/CC he/PRP never/RB appeared/VB in/IN another/DT movie/NN again/RB after/IN this/DT (I/NN guess/VB he/PRP just/RB couldn't/VB live/VB down/RB being/VB the/DT guy/NN who/WH was/VB rapped/VB by/RP Raquel/NN Welch)./NN And/CC as/IN anyone/NN could/MD guess/VB from/IN the/DT description/NN above,/NN Mae/NN West/NN was/VB totally/RB out/RB of/IN her/PRP$ mind/NN when/WH she/PRP agreed/VB to/TO do/VB this/DT movie/NN -/. but/CC that's/NN part/NN of/IN what/WH makes/VB it/PRP fun/NN for/IN those/DT of/IN us/PRP who/WH love/VB
