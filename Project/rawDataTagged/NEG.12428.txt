It/PRP was/VB difficult/JJ to/TO sit/VB through/IN this/DT horrible/JJ heretical/JJ adaptation/NN of/RP Sherlock/NN Holmes./NN Apparently/RB Matt/NN Frewer/NN was/VB cast/VB because/IN he/PRP is/VB tall/JJ and/CC skinny./VB His/PRP$ skull-like/NN face/NN made/VB for/IN a/DT good/JJ zombie/NN in/IN the/DT Dawn/NN of/IN the/DT Dead/NN remake,/. but/CC as/RB Sherlock/NN Holmes/NN he/PRP looks/VB like/IN a/DT scarecrow./NN Not/RB only/RB does/VB Frewer/NN have/VB a/DT lanky/NN lackadaisical/NN walk/VB that/WH is/VB hard/JJ to/TO watch,/NN but/CC he/PRP looks/VB uncomfortable/JJ in/IN the/DT stereotypical/NN Holmes/NN overcoats/. that/WH he/PRP is/VB wearing./VB Not/RB only/RB that,/. but/CC while/IN the/DT coat/NN is/VB gray/JJ twill/. they/PRP apparently/RB could/MD not/RB find/VB a/DT matching/JJ cap./NN So/IN his/PRP$ cap/NN is/VB black/JJ and/CC it/PRP looks/VB shiny/JJ as/IN if/IN it/PRP were/VB made/VB of/IN polyester./NN Whatever/WH the/DT cap/NN was/VB made/VB of,/IN it/PRP looked/VB very/RB new/JJ and/CC artificial./NN Jeremy/NN Brett/NN occasionally/RB wore/VB those/DT traditional/JJ outfits,/NN but/RB Brett/NN did/VB not/RB have/VB to/TO dress-up/VB like/VB Sherlock/NN Holmes/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO look/VB the/DT part./RP Frewer/NN on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN is/VB painful/JJ to/TO watch./VB Even/RB in/IN the/DT full/JJ "Holmes"/NN outfit,/. he/PRP does/VB not/RB carry/VB himself/PRP like/VB Sherlock/NN Holmes.<br/NN /><br/IN />Frewer's/DT cadaverous/NN face/NN grinning/IN all/PDT the/DT time/NN as/IN he/PRP spouts/VB on/IN and/CC on/IN in/IN a/DT very/RB bad/JJ "Upper-Crust"/NN British/NN accent/NN is/VB painful/JJ to/TO see/VB and/CC listen/VB to./VB To/TO say/VB that/WH Frewer/NN is/VB overacting/TO is/VB an/DT understatement./NN After/IN he/PRP finishes/VB each/DT sentence/NN with/IN some/DT kind/NN of/IN nasal/NN hum,/. he/PRP then/RB sneers/VB as/RB if/IN that/WH were/VB some/DT kind/NN of/IN British/JJ trait./NN When/WH I/PRP started/VB watching/VB this/DT I/PRP thought/VB it/PRP might/MD be/VB a/DT comedy/NN featuring/VB Wishbone,/NN the/DT Jack/NN Russell/NN Terrier./NN I/PRP thought/VB Frewer/NN had/VB been/VB cast/VB as/IN some/DT kind/NN of/IN foil/VB for/RP Wishbone./NN But/CC sadly,/VB there/EX is/VB no/DT dog/NN in/IN this/DT movie/NN except/IN for/RB Frewer./NN Wishbone/NN would/MD have/VB made/VB this/DT movie/NN a/DT lot/NN better.<br/IN /><br/DT />Not/NN only/RB does/VB Frewer's/NN version/NN of/RP Sherlock/NN Holmes/NN never/RB stop/VB talking/VB (in/IN that/DT awfully/NN artificial/IN British/JJ nasal/NN accent),/. but/CC he/PRP is/VB much/RB to/TO friendly/JJ and/CC kind./RP Frewer/NN is/VB always/RB smiling/VB at/IN the/DT witnesses/NN he/PRP talks/VB to,/NN and/CC he/PRP is/VB so/RB polite/JJ and/CC courteous/NN that/IN he/PRP could/MD be/VB teaching/NN at/IN a/FW Charm/NN School/NN instead/RB of/IN being/VB a/FW Sleuth./NN Perhaps/RB since/IN this/DT is/VB a/DT Hallmark/NN Channel/NN production,/. they/PRP are/VB trying/VB to/TO make/VB a/DT children's/NN version/NN of/RP Sherlock/NN Holmes/NN (Wishbone/NN was/VB better/RB at/IN that,/DT too)/NN that/WH was/VB kindler/NN and/CC gentler./NN Whatever/WH the/DT point/NN of/RP Frewer's/NN interpretation/NN of/RP Sherlock/NN Holmes,/NN it/PRP is/VB flatter/NN than/IN a/DT pancake,/NN and/CC easily/RB the/DT worst/JJ version/NN of/RP Sherlock/NN Holmes/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VB ever/RB seen/VB (including/IN the/DT previous/JJ worst,/NN by/IN Charlton/NN Heston).<br/NN /><br/NN />Overall,/IN the/DT tone/NN of/IN this/DT film/NN is/VB awful./IN It/PRP reminded/VB me/PRP of/IN a/DT typical/JJ episode/NN of/RP Barnaby/NN Jones/NN or/CC Murder/NN She/PRP Wrote/NN or/CC Diagnosis/NN Murder./NN All/PDT the/DT suspects/NN over-acted/NN suspiciously/. and/CC glared/NN at/IN the/DT victims/NN before/IN they/PRP were/VB killed./DT Holmes/NN and/CC Watson/NN are/VB explaining/VB every/DT clue/NN to/TO each/DT other/JJ during/IN the/DT entire/JJ movie./NN Even/RB on/RP Murder/NN She/PRP Wrote/NN there/EX is/VB less/JJ exposition.<br/NN /><br/VB />This/RP Sherlock/NN Holmes/NN does/VB not/RB even/RB compare/VB very/RB well/RB to/TO Jim/NN Rockford/NN of/IN the/DT Rockford/NN Files/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VB miles/NN below/RB Columbo./NN The/DT awful/JJ dialog/NN is/VB probably/RB the/DT fault/NN of/IN the/DT writer./NN It/PRP is/VB obvious/JJ that/IN who/WH ever/RB wrote/VB this/DT script/NN has/VB very/RB little/JJ familiarity/NN with/RP Sherlock/NN Holmes,/NN especially/RB the/DT BBC/NN version/NN with/IN Jeremy/NN Brett./NN This/DT movie/NN has/VB all/DT of/IN the/DT atmosphere/NN of/IN an/DT episode/NN of/IN Little/NN House/NN on/IN the/DT Prairie./NN The/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT

spot/NN is/VB Ken/NN Walsh/NN who/WH plays/VB Doctor/NN Watson/NN with/IN some/DT dignity./NN Walsh/NN does/VB not/RB ham/NN it/PRP up/RB compared/VB to/TO Frewer,/NN and/CC when/WH he/PRP is/VB
