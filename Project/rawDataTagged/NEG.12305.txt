There/EX is/VB an/DT interesting/JJ discussion/NN in/IN this/DT movie./NN Is/VB being/VB a/DT moral/JJ person/NN good/JJ enough,/NN or/CC do/VB you/PRP need/VB something/NN more?<br/IN /><br/DT />The/NN movie/NN preaches/NN that/IN without/IN the/DT guidance/VB of/RP God,/NN being/VB a/DT morally/RB good/JJ person/NN is/VB not/RB enough./. There/EX is/VB a/DT line/NN early/RB in/IN the/DT movie,/NN "You/. and/CC I/PRP can/MD look/VB at/IN a/DT person/NN who/WH is/VB morally/RB good,/. but/CC both/DT know/VB he/PRP is/VB going/VB to/TO go/VB to/TO hell."<br/VB /><br/TO />While/VB I/PRP am/VB not/RB a/DT Christian,/NN the/DT discussions/NN about/IN this/DT throughout/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN the/DT movie/NN were/VB fascinating,/NN but/CC not/RB in/IN the/DT way/NN the/DT movie/NN intended./. I/PRP left/VB the/DT movie/NN with/IN a/DT stronger/JJ feeling/NN that/WH being/VB morally/RB good/JJ *is*/NN enough./IN The/DT arguments/NN and/CC discussions/NN presented/VB were/VB heavily/RB biased,/VB so/RB much/RB so/RB that/IN they/PRP crush/VB themselves/PRP in/IN the/DT weight/NN of/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ ignorance./RP Fanaticism/NN can/MD be/VB a/DT powerful/JJ thing,/NN especially/RB when/WH inferenced/VB in/IN the/DT minds/NN of/IN the/DT ignorant/NN and/CC uneducated./NN As/IN George/NN Carlin's/NN character/NN in/RP Dogma/NN said:/IN "hook/DT em/NN while/IN they're/DT young".<br/NN /><br/IN />The/DT basic/JJ premise/NN is/VB a/DT very/RB interesting/JJ one/CD also./IN A/DT Bible/NN Scholar/NN from/IN the/DT 1890s/NN is/VB attempting/VB to/TO publish/VB a/DT book/NN that/WH says/VB that/IN morality/NN without/IN God/NN is/VB OK,/NN as/IN long/JJ as/IN the/DT morality/NN is/VB meaningful./TO Do/VB you/PRP only/RB tell/VB a/DT child/NN not/RB to/TO steal?/NN Or/CC do/VB you/PRP tell/VB him/PRP not/RB to/TO steal/VB because/IN God/NN tells/VB you/PRP not/RB to?/VB (not/DT bothering/NN bringing/VB up/RP that/WH telling/VB the/DT child/NN not/RB to/TO steal/VB because,/DT well,/NN how/WH would/MD he/PRP feel/VB if/IN it/PRP was/VB his/PRP$ marbles/NN that/WH were/VB stolen?)<br/DT /><br/NN />The/VB author,/RP Carlisle,/NN wants/VB the/DT recommendation/NN of/IN his/PRP$ school/NN to/TO help/VB sell/VB the/DT book/NN (to/NN spread/VB the/DT world)./RP However,/NN it/PRP needs/VB unanimous/JJ consent,/NN and/CC one/CD of/IN the/DT scholars/NN opposes/VB it./IN He/PRP brings/VB up,/NN in/IN a/DT very/RB interesting/JJ discussion/NN early/RB in/IN the/DT film/NN about/IN the/DT morality/NN for/IN morality's/NN sake/VB vs/RP God's/NN words/NN argument./VB To/TO prove/VB his/PRP$ point,/NN he/PRP produces/VB a/DT time/NN machine/NN (put/NN in/IN the/DT movie/NN solely/RB to/TO make/VB the/DT plot/NN work,/. which/WH I'm/NN fine/NN with),/. and/CC sends/VB Carlisle/NN to/TO the/DT year/NN 2002/CD to/TO see/VB where/WH teaching/VB morality/NN without/IN God/NN will/MD lead/VB us.<br/IN /><br/DT />As/NN should/MD be/VB obvious,/IN he/PRP has/VB his/PRP$ opinion,/NN and/CC is/VB changed/VB by/IN what/WH he/PRP sees,/VB and/CC has/VB reversed/VB himself/PRP by/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN his/PRP$ return/NN (for/. he/PRP does/VB return,/TO that's/VB not/RB really/RB a/DT spoiler,/NN this/DT is/VB a/DT bible/NN movie/NN after/IN all).<br/DT /><br/NN />As/NN for/IN the/DT movie/NN as/IN a/DT movie/NN itself,/NN it's/VB pretty/RB slow/JJ and/CC pretty/RB poorly/RB acted./JJ Something/NN that/WH was/VB *not*/TO needed/VB in/IN this/DT movie,/NN is/VB that/IN it/PRP produces/VB two/CD "bad/NN guys"/. who/WH want/VB to/TO try/VB to/TO figure/VB out/RP who/WH Carlisle/NN is,/VB even/RB tho/VB he/PRP hasn't/MD hurt/VB anyone,/TO committed/VB a/DT crime,/NN or/CC anything./RP What's/NN wrong/JJ with/IN the/DT movie/NN just/RB showing/VB Carlisle's/NN opinion,/NN showing/VB his/PRP$ view/NN of/IN this/DT "sinful/NN world",/. and/CC returning/VB him/PRP with/IN a/DT new/JJ viewpoint?/NN <br/IN /><br/DT />Also,/NN there/RB a/DT few/JJ points/NN in/IN the/DT movie/NN which/WH affirm/VB to/TO me/PRP that/WH I'm/NN happy/JJ I'm/NN not/RB a/DT Christian,/NN or/CC at/IN least/JJ someone/NN who/WH says/VB "It's/DT God/NN or/CC nothing"./$ Three/CD near/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT movie/NN rather/RB disturbed/VB me../DT first,/NN when/WH the/DT two/CD "bad/NN guys"/NN corner/VB Carlisle/NN right/NN before/IN he/PRP jumps,/RP Carlisle/NN does/VB his/PRP$ *only*/NN truly/RB despicable/JJ act../. he/PRP fakes/VB like/IN his/PRP$ time-jump/NN is/VB the/DT coming/VB of/RP Jesus,/NN and/CC makes/VB it/PRP so/RB the/DT "bad/NN guys"/NN (who/NN are/VB also/RB Christians/NN btw,/VB oddly/RB enough),/VB think/VB they/PRP just/RB missed/VB the/DT rapture./NN <br/IN /><br/DT />Secondly,/NN after/RB Carlisle/NN returns,/. he/PRP finds/VB a/DT boy/NN in/IN which/WH he/PRP scolded/VB at/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN the/DT movie/NN about/IN not/RB stealing/VB (but/VB not/RB mentioning/VB God,/NN kid/NN kept/VB the/DT marbles/NN and/CC ran/VB away),/NN and/CC tells/VB him/PRP this/DT time/NN that/WH stealing/VB is/VB wrong/JJ because/IN God/NN commands/NN it./NN Like/IN the/DT Carlin/NN quote/NN above,/NN scaring/VB kids/NN into/IN religion/NN is/VB a/DT faux-pas/NN in/IN my/PRP$ book.<br/NN /><br/NN />And/NN lastly,/IN the/DT epilogue./NN Another/DT scare/VB tactic./RP Carlisle/NN asks/VB the/DT inventor/NN how/WH far/RB into/IN the/DT future/JJ they/PRP could/MD go,/VB and/CC he/PRP says/VB he/PRP doesn't/VB know../IN the/DT epilogue/NN shows/VB him/PRP trying/VB to/TO warp/VB a/DT bible/NN into/IN the/DT distant/JJ future/JJ (starts/NN at/IN 2100),/NN and/CC it/PRP fails../VB he/PRP keeps/VB decrementing/IN the/DT years/NN by/RP 10,/CD and/CC trying/VB again,/NN and/CC by/IN the/DT fade-out,/NN he's/NN at/IN like/VB 2030/CD or/CC so./NN Throughout/IN the/DT movie,/RP Carlise/NN mentions/VB that/IN he/PRP felt/VB the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN coming,/NN because/IN the/DT world/NN was/VB rife/JJ with/IN sin/NN and/CC the/DT loss/NN of/IN the/DT name/NN of/RP God../NN scare/NN tactics/NN have/VB been/VB in/IN use/NN for/IN thousands/NN of/IN years../VB you/PRP would/MD think/VB in/IN these/DT enlightened/VB times,/IN the/DT church/NN would/MD have/VB enlightened/VB as/IN well.<br/NN /><br/IN />I'm/DT glad/JJ I/PRP saw/VB this/DT movie./NN While/IN I/PRP was/VB fairly/RB certain/JJ before/IN that/WH being/VB morally/RB good/JJ was/VB enough,/VB now/RB I/PRP know/VB it/PRP for/IN a/DT fact./NN Worth/NN watching/VB if/IN you/PRP are/VB not/RB a/DT Christian,/NN to/TO affirm/VB how/WH happy/JJ you/PRP are/VB to/TO not/RB be/VB as/IN ignorant/NN as/IN the/DT folks/NN in/IN this/DT movie./NN
