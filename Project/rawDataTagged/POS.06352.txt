"Anchors/TO Aweigh"/NN is/VB the/DT product/NN of/IN the/DT classic/JJ MGM/NN musical/JJ production/NN unit,/. and/CC on/IN the/DT whole/JJ the/DT film/NN is/VB every/DT enjoyable/JJ /NN good/JJ music/NN by/RP Jule/NN Styne/NN and/CC others,/DT excellent/JJ dancing/NN by/IN Gene/NN Kelly/NN (and/VB even/RB a/DT passable/NN job/NN by/IN Frank/NN Sinatra),/NN and/CC a/DT funny/JJ well-paced/NN

the/DT presence/NN of/IN his/PRP$ less/JJ cocksure/NN friend/NN with/IN the/DT improbable/NN middle-American/NN name/NN of/IN Clarence/NN (Sinatra)./NN Upon/IN receiving/VB 3/CD days/NN of/IN shore/NN leave/VB for/IN saving/VB Clarence's/NN life,/NN Joe/NN reluctantly/RB agrees/VB to/TO help/VB Clarence/NN find/VB a/DT girl/NN based/VB on/IN the/DT dubious/JJ premise/NN that/IN he/PRP owes/VB

"Tom/NN and/CC Jerry"/NN (although/. he/PRP seems/VB to/TO be/VB closer/RB in/IN size/NN to/TO a/DT dog/NN or/CC cat/NN here/RB than/IN to/TO a/DT mouse)./RP It's/NN a/DT startling/JJ sequence/NN
